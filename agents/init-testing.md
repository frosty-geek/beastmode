## Explore These Sources

- Test directories: `tests/`, `__tests__/`, `spec/`, `test/`
- Test file patterns: `*_test.*`, `*.spec.*`, `*.test.*`
- Test config: `jest.config.*`, `vitest.config.*`, `pytest.ini`, `conftest.py`, `phpunit.xml`
- CI/CD for test commands: `.github/workflows/*.yml`
- Sample 2-3 test files for patterns
