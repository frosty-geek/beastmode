# Commit Categorization

## Context
Release artifacts need to present changes in organized categories rather than raw commit lists.

## Decision
Commits categorized by conventional commit type: `feat` -> Features, `fix` -> Fixes, `docs` -> Docs, `chore`/`refactor` -> Chores. Breaking changes get their own section regardless of commit type. Docs-only releases note "No code changes" in Full Changelog.

## Rationale
Conventional commits provide a machine-parseable categorization scheme. Mapping to human-readable section names (Features vs feat) makes changelogs scannable without knowledge of the convention. Chores category added in v0.14.1 for non-feature, non-fix work.
