# Release Process

## Merge Strategy
- ALWAYS use `git merge --squash` to collapse feature branch into one commit on main — clean history

## Retro Timing
- ALWAYS pass all phase artifacts (design, plan, implement, validate, release) to the context walker in a single session — one coherent pass per release
- Retro runs at step 8, commit at step 9 — ordered sequence prevents untracked context files

## Release Rollup
- ALWAYS prepare L0 update proposal from L1 summaries at release time — controlled L0 evolution
- Retro propagates L3 -> L2 -> L1 -> L0 automatically — all changes auto-apply, no approval gate
- BEASTMODE.md gains updated process sections via L0 proposal mechanism — targeted updates

## Version File Management
- ALWAYS treat plugin.json as the version source of truth — single authority
- ALWAYS update: plugin.json, marketplace.json, CHANGELOG.md — three version files
- NEVER embed version in README or PRODUCT.md — reduced from 5 files in v0.6.1
