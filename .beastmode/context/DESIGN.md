# Design Context

## Product
- ALWAYS design before code — structured phases prevent wasted implementation
- NEVER skip the retro sub-phase — it's how the system learns and improves
- Capabilities include: collaborative design, bite-sized planning, parallel wave execution, git worktree isolation via external Justfile orchestrator, brownfield discovery with 17-domain init system, progressive knowledge hierarchy, self-improving retro, commit-per-phase with squash-at-release, session-start hook, unified /beastmode command (init, status, ideas, orchestrate subcommands), deferred ideas capture and reconciliation, deadpan persona, manifest-based local state with optional GitHub mirroring for issue-based lifecycle tracking, WorktreeCreate hook for feature branch detection, pipeline orchestration with CronCreate polling, multi-epic parallelism, and per-feature agent fan-out

## Architecture
- ALWAYS follow the progressive loading pattern — L0 autoloads, L1 loads at prime, L2 on-demand
- NEVER use @imports between hierarchy levels — convention-based paths only
- Three data domains: State (feature workflow), Context (published knowledge), Meta (process knowledge with process + workarounds domains). Manifest JSON is the operational authority for feature lifecycle; GitHub is a synced mirror updated at checkpoint boundaries when enabled
- ALWAYS create a matching L3 directory for every L2 file — structural invariant for retro expansion
- State has no L1 index files — only empty phase subdirs with .gitkeep as workflow containers
- research/ lives at .beastmode/ root, not under state/ — reference material is not workflow state
- Sub-phase anatomy is invariant: prime -> execute -> validate -> checkpoint
- Skills MUST detect when already running inside an agent worktree and skip their own worktree creation — prevents double-worktree nesting
- NEVER write to context/ or meta/ directly from phases — retro is the sole gatekeeper
- Retro reconciliation is artifact-scoped — quick-check L1 first, deep-check L2 only when stale
- Meta walker mirrors context walker algorithm — L1 quick-check, L2 deep-check, L3 record management with confidence-gated promotion
- NEVER skip retro — walkers handle empty phases gracefully, no quick-exit gating

## Task Runner
- ALWAYS track tasks via TodoWrite — one in_progress at a time
- NEVER expand linked files eagerly — lazy expansion on first visit only
- Gate steps (`## N. [GATE|...]`) are structural — cannot be bypassed

## Release Workflow
- ALWAYS run retro from checkpoint before merge — consistent across all five phases
- ALWAYS commit per phase on the feature branch — each phase persists work at checkpoint for cross-session durability
- ALWAYS squash-merge feature branch at release — per-phase commits collapse to one clean commit on main
- ALWAYS archive branch tip before squash merge

## Phase Transitions
External orchestrator drives phase transitions via Justfile recipes. Each phase is a separate `claude` invocation with a fresh session. Skills are pure content processors with no worktree or transition logic. Checkpoint prints the `just` command for the next phase. Only the checkpoint may produce next-step commands; retro agents are banned from transition guidance. The pipeline orchestrator provides a second advancement path: CronCreate poll loop scans state files and spawns worktree-isolated agents to drive epics through plan -> release automatically.

1. ALWAYS use Justfile recipes to invoke phases — `just <phase> <slug>` is the entry point
2. NEVER embed worktree or transition logic in skills — skills assume correct working directory
3. ALWAYS print `just <next-phase> <slug>` at checkpoint — human runs next step explicitly
4. NEVER auto-chain phases — each phase is a separate session
5. NEVER print transition guidance from retro agents — checkpoint is the sole authority
6. ALWAYS STOP after printing transition output — no additional output

## Tech Stack
- NEVER add package runtime dependencies — beastmode is markdown interpreted by Claude Code. GitHub API via `gh` CLI is an infrastructure dependency
- ALWAYS use markdown + YAML frontmatter for skill definitions
- Distribution via Claude Code marketplace

## Init System
5-phase bootstrapping system (skeleton, inventory, write, retro, synthesize) that detects 17 L2 domains and produces retro-compatible output. Writers and retros run in parallel. Greenfield mode installs skeleton only.

1. ALWAYS follow 5-phase init order: skeleton install -> inventory -> write -> retro -> synthesize
2. ALWAYS produce ALWAYS/NEVER format in L2 and Context/Decision/Rationale in L3 — unified with retro output
3. NEVER include beastmode-specific domains in skeleton — retro creates those
4. ALWAYS run retro pass after writers even on empty state/ — no conditional gating

## GitHub State Model
Manifest JSON is the operational authority for feature lifecycle. GitHub is a synced mirror updated at checkpoint boundaries when github.enabled is true. Two-level issue hierarchy (Epic > Feature) with label-based state machines. Only Epics appear on the Projects V2 board — Features retain labels and sub-issue linkage but are not board items. Subagents are GitHub-unaware; only checkpoints read/write manifests and sync GitHub. GitHub API failures warn and continue without blocking.

1. ALWAYS use two-level hierarchy: Epic (capability) > Feature (work unit) with label-based type/phase/status encoding
2. ALWAYS use manifest JSON as operational authority — GitHub is a synced mirror, not the source of truth
3. ALWAYS sync GitHub at checkpoint boundaries only — one sync step per phase between artifact-save and retro
4. NEVER let GitHub API failures block workflow — warn and continue, next checkpoint retries
5. NEVER make subagents GitHub-aware — only the checkpoint (main conversation) handles manifest and GitHub sync
6. ALWAYS use 12-label taxonomy: 2 type, 7 phase, 3 status (ready, in-progress, blocked) plus gate/awaiting-approval — status/review is dropped
7. ALWAYS use github.enabled config toggle to control GitHub sync — when false, all GitHub steps are silently skipped

## Pipeline Orchestration
CronCreate-based poll loop that scans local state files and spawns worktree-isolated agents to drive epics through plan -> release in parallel. One team per epic, one agent per phase, fan-out per feature at implement. Design phase is excluded (interactive). Respects config.yaml gates and relays blocked agents to the user.

1. ALWAYS use local state files as the authority for orchestration decisions — not GitHub labels
2. NEVER orchestrate design phase — interactive by nature, requires human collaboration
3. ALWAYS merge implement worktrees sequentially and verify manifest completeness before advancing to validate
4. ALWAYS respect config.yaml gate settings — human gates pause the agent and relay to user
5. ALWAYS spawn agents with worktree isolation — skills inside agents detect existing worktree and skip their own creation
