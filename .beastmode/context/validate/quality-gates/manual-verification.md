# Manual Verification

## Context
Some validation gates require human judgment that cannot be automated — verifying skill invocation behavior, checking for placeholder patterns in context files, confirming banner visibility in new sessions.

## Decision
Manual verification gates are explicitly listed alongside automated checks. Deferred checks (requiring a new session, for example) are marked DEFER rather than PASS or FAIL.

## Rationale
Honest reporting of what was and was not verified prevents false confidence. DEFER status tracks items that need follow-up without blocking the release.
