## Context
The CLI had two divergent scanner implementations (state-scanner.ts and scanEpicsInline in watch-command.ts) with 19 concrete divergences causing inconsistent epic state reporting.

## Decision
Rewrite state-scanner.ts as the single canonical scanner. Kill the inline scanner entirely. Scanner is read-only — never writes to the filesystem. Discover epics by reading manifest files from the pipeline directory only, with no design file dependency.

## Rationale
Two scanners disagreeing about state is worse than one scanner with a bug. Read-only separation ensures the scanner can run on any tick without side effects. Manifests-only anchoring removes the design file dependency — pre-manifest epics are all released and don't need tracking.
