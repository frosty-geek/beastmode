# Data Domains

## Context
Different types of information have different lifecycles and purposes. Feature state, build knowledge, and self-improvement data need distinct update patterns.

## Decision
Three domains: State (feature workflow at `.beastmode/state/`), Context (published knowledge at `.beastmode/context/`), Meta (process knowledge at `.beastmode/meta/`). State tracks where features are — structured as empty phase subdirs with .gitkeep only, no L1 index files. Context documents how to build. Meta captures how to improve with two L2 domains per phase: process (process patterns) and workarounds (beastmode feedback). Meta L3 records are topic-clustered with accumulated observations and confidence tags. Research lives at `.beastmode/research/` (not under state/) as reference material. Every L2 file has a matching L3 directory with .gitkeep for retro expansion.

## Rationale
- Clear separation enables focused updates without cross-contamination
- State as workflow tracker maps naturally to feature lifecycle
- Meta enables continuous improvement through retro-captured learnings
- Two-domain split (process vs workarounds) separates process patterns from tool feedback
- Topic clustering enables observation accumulation and frequency-based promotion
