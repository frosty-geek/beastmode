# Architecture

## Knowledge Hierarchy
- ALWAYS follow progressive loading: L0 autoloads, L1 at prime, L2 on-demand, L3 linked from L2 — prevents context bloat
- NEVER @import between levels — convention-based paths prevent circular dependencies
- L2 domains follow tiered taxonomy: Tier 1 universal, Tier 2 high-frequency, Tier 3 retro-driven — prioritizes loading order
- L1 uses UPPERCASE.md, L2 uses lowercase.md — visual distinction at filesystem level
- ALWAYS use absolute directives (NEVER/ALWAYS) for non-negotiable rules in L1/L2 — enforces clarity
- L3 records ALWAYS have four sections: Context, Decision, Rationale, Source — standardizes decision records
- L0 contains persona + map only — operational details belong in skills, not the autoloaded manual
- Each level follows standardized format: summary paragraph, sections, numbered rules, convention paths — consistency across hierarchy

## Data Domains
- NEVER mix domain concerns — State tracks features, Context documents knowledge, Meta captures process knowledge
- ALWAYS write phase artifacts to `state/` — retro promotes to `context/` and `meta/`
- Write protection: phases write `state/` only, retro promotes — prevents unauthorized knowledge edits
- Meta has two L2 domains per phase: process.md and workarounds.md — separates process patterns from beastmode feedback
- Meta L3 records are topic-clustered with confidence tags — no date prefixes, observations accumulate by topic

## Sub-Phase Anatomy
- Every phase follows: 0-prime, 1-execute, 2-validate, 3-checkpoint — standardized lifecycle
- ALWAYS enter worktree in prime before state file reads — step 3 in plan/implement primes
- 0-prime is read-only except for worktree entry (cd) — no other side effects
- 3-checkpoint triggers retro agents — context walker + meta walker in parallel

## Component Architecture
- Skills (workflow verbs) in `/skills/`, shared utilities in `skills/_shared/`, retro agents in `/agents/` — separation of concerns
- ALWAYS colocate interface (SKILL.md) with implementation — discoverability
- NEVER put shared logic in individual skills — extract to `skills/_shared/`
- Retro agents are phase-scoped — context walker and meta walker review their phase's domain docs

## Worktree Isolation
- ALWAYS use `git merge --squash` for releases — one commit per version on main
- ALWAYS archive branch tips before deletion: `archive/feature/<name>` — preserves history
- NEVER modify main branch during feature work — worktree provides isolation
- Cross-session discovery: phases resolve feature worktree from explicit argument or fallback scan — multi-session continuity
- Created at /design, inherited through plan/implement/validate, squash-merged by /release — full lifecycle

## HITL Gate System
- NEVER skip gate steps — `## N. [GATE|...]` steps are structural task-runner items that cannot be bypassed
- Configurable gates resolve from `.beastmode/config.yaml` at runtime — flexibility without hardcoding
- Gate syntax: `## N. [GATE|namespace.gate-id]` with GATE-OPTION subsections — standardized format
- NEVER place competing gate mechanisms on the same decision point — avoids ambiguity
- Auto-transitions use `Skill(skill="beastmode:<next>", args="<artifact>")` with fully-qualified names — explicit chaining
- Context threshold checks determine whether to auto-advance or print session-restart instructions — prevents degraded behavior

## Retro Knowledge Promotion
- ALWAYS run retro before release commit — context walker + meta walker in parallel
- Retro reconciliation is artifact-scoped — only checks docs relevant to the new state artifact
- L0 promotion happens only during release phase via L0 proposal files in state/release/ — controlled rollup
- NEVER write to context/ or meta/ directly from phases — retro is the sole gatekeeper
- Meta promotion is confidence-gated: [HIGH] immediate, [MEDIUM]+3 to L1, [LOW]+3 to [MEDIUM] — graduated trust
- Two meta retro gates: retro.records (L3 writes) and retro.promotions (L1/L2 upgrades) — granular control
- Single `retro.context-write` gate covers context doc writes — unified approval
