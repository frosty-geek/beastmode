# Architecture

System design for beastmode. L0/L1/L2/L3 progressive loading hierarchy with standardized format per level. Three data domains (State/Context/Meta). Worktree isolation for implementation. Squash-per-release commits. Two-tier HITL gate system with task-runner enforcement. Artifact-scoped retro reconciliation. Write-protected knowledge promotion.

## Knowledge Hierarchy
Four-level progressive enhancement: L0 (system manual, autoloaded), L1 (phase summaries, loaded at prime), L2 (full detail, on-demand), L3 (records, linked from L2). Each level follows standardized format: summary paragraph, sections grouped by child-level topics, numbered rules, convention paths. L0 contains only persona spec and high-level workflow map; operational details (hierarchy paths, write protection, gate mechanics, sub-phase anatomy) live in skills.

1. ALWAYS follow progressive loading — L0 autoloads, L1 at prime, L2 on-demand, L3 linked from L2
2. NEVER use @imports between levels — convention-based paths only
3. L2 domains follow tiered taxonomy: Tier 1 (universal), Tier 2 (high-frequency), Tier 3 (specialized/retro-driven)
4. L1 files use UPPERCASE.md naming, L2 use lowercase.md
5. ALWAYS use absolute directives (NEVER/ALWAYS) for non-negotiable rules in L1/L2 files
6. L3 records ALWAYS have four sections: Context, Decision, Rationale, Source
7. L0 contains persona + map only — operational details belong in skills, not in the autoloaded system manual

## Data Domains
Three domains with distinct purposes: State (feature workflow, `.beastmode/state/`), Context (published knowledge, `.beastmode/context/`), Meta (learnings/SOPs/overrides, `.beastmode/meta/`). Meta uses three L2 files per phase: `sops.md` (reusable procedures), `overrides.md` (project-specific rules), `learnings.md` (session-specific, append-only).

1. NEVER mix domain concerns — State tracks features, Context documents knowledge, Meta captures learnings
2. ALWAYS write phase artifacts to `state/` — retro promotes to `context/` and `meta/`
3. Write protection: phases write `state/` only; retro promotes to context and meta
4. Meta domain ALWAYS has three L2 files per phase: sops.md, overrides.md, learnings.md

## Sub-Phase Anatomy
Every workflow phase follows: 0-prime (context load + worktree entry), 1-execute (action phase), 2-validate (quality check), 3-checkpoint (persistence + retro).

1. ALWAYS enter worktree in prime before state file reads — step 3 in plan/implement primes
2. 0-prime is read-only except for worktree entry (cd) — no other side effects
3. 3-checkpoint triggers retro agents (context walker + meta walker in parallel)

## Component Architecture
Skills (workflow verbs) in `/skills/`, shared utilities in `skills/_shared/`, retro agents in `/agents/`. Each skill has SKILL.md manifest, `phases/` directory (0-3), and optional `references/`.

1. ALWAYS colocate interface (SKILL.md) with implementation
2. NEVER put shared logic in individual skills — use `skills/_shared/`
3. Retro agents are phase-scoped — context walker and meta walker review their phase's domain docs

## Worktree Isolation
Feature work in isolated git worktrees at `.beastmode/worktrees/`. Created at /design, inherited through plan/implement/validate, squash-merged by /release. Cross-session discovery resolves feature worktree from explicit argument (state file path) or fallback scan of `.beastmode/worktrees/`.

1. ALWAYS use `git merge --squash` for releases — one commit per version on main
2. ALWAYS archive branch tips before deletion: `archive/feature/<name>`
3. NEVER modify main branch during feature work — worktree provides isolation
4. Cross-session discovery: phases resolve feature worktree from explicit argument or fallback scan

## HITL Gate System
Two-tier: unconditional gates (always enforced, embedded as structural task-runner steps) and configurable gates (human/auto resolved from config.yaml). Task runner handles detection and substep pruning. Auto-transitions between phases use `Skill(skill="beastmode:<next>", args="<artifact>")` with fully-qualified names. Context threshold checks determine whether to auto-advance or print session-restart instructions.

1. NEVER skip gate steps — `## N. [GATE|...]` steps are structural task-runner items that cannot be bypassed
2. Configurable gates resolve from `.beastmode/config.yaml` at runtime
3. Gate syntax: `## N. [GATE|namespace.gate-id]` with GATE-OPTION subsections
4. NEVER place competing gate mechanisms on the same decision point

## Retro Knowledge Promotion
Artifact-scoped reconciliation: context walker quick-checks L1, deep-checks L2 only when stale, recognizes new areas without confidence scoring. Single `retro.context-write` gate covers all context doc writes. Meta walker runs independently for learnings/SOPs/overrides. Retro owns L2->L1 propagation; release owns L1->L0 via rollup step.

1. ALWAYS run retro before release commit — context walker + meta walker in parallel
2. Retro reconciliation is artifact-scoped — only checks docs relevant to the new state artifact
3. L0 promotion happens only during release phase via L0 proposal files in state/release/
4. NEVER write to context/ or meta/ directly from phases — retro is the sole gatekeeper
