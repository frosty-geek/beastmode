# Post-Dispatch Pipeline

## Context
After each phase dispatch, the CLI needs to read results, update the manifest, and sync GitHub. The manifest-file-management design introduces Stop hook output.json generation and a mutation-return pattern for github-sync.ts.

## Decision
After every phase dispatch: Stop hook generates output.json from artifact frontmatter, CLI reads output.json from `artifacts/<phase>/`, enriches manifest via manifest.ts pure functions (enrich, advancePhase, shouldAdvance), then runs `syncGitHub(manifest, config)`. github-sync.ts returns mutations instead of mutating manifests in-place — caller applies via manifest.ts + store.save(). Same code path for manual `beastmode <phase>` and watch loop dispatch. Post-only stateless sync.

## Rationale
Stop hook generates output.json by infrastructure, eliminating skill-authored output steps. Pure function enrichment is testable without filesystem mocks. Mutation-return from github-sync.ts ensures all manifest writes go through the store, maintaining the single-writer invariant.
