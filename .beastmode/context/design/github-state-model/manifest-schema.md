# Manifest Schema

## Context
Feature lifecycle needs a local JSON artifact that tracks state across phases and optionally includes GitHub references. The manifest-file-management design introduces a unified PipelineManifest type with a two-module split.

## Decision
PipelineManifest is pure pipeline state at `.beastmode/state/YYYY-MM-DD-<slug>.manifest.json` (local-only, gitignored). Schema: slug, epic?, originId?, phase (Phase), features (ManifestFeature[]), artifacts (Record<string, string[]>), summary? ({ problem, solution }), worktree? ({ branch, path }), github? ({ epic, repo, bodyHash? }), blocked? ({ gate, reason } | null), lastUpdated (ISO-8601). ManifestFeature extended with optional description field. Design checkpoint populates summary (problem/solution), plan checkpoint populates per-feature description. `slug` is an immutable 6-character hex assigned at worktree creation. `epic` is the human-readable name set by `store.rename()` after design phase. `originId` preserves lineage (birth hex to final epic name). CLI creates at first phase dispatch via store.create(slug) — manifest exists before skill session starts. Enriched from output.json (Stop hook auto-generates from artifact frontmatter) at each checkpoint. CLI is the sole mutator via manifest-store.ts + manifest.ts. github-sync.ts returns mutations instead of mutating in-place. Four feature statuses: pending, in-progress, completed, blocked. CLI rebuilds from worktree branch scanning on cold start.

## Rationale
Unified PipelineManifest eliminates competing types. Two-module split separates filesystem (store) from logic (pure functions), making state transitions testable with plain objects. Structured blocked field provides actionable status information. Directory rename from pipeline/ to state/ makes the name match the content.
