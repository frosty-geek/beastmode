# Status Display

## Context
The status command renders a table of all epics with their current state.

## Decision
Table columns are Epic, Phase, Progress, Blocked, Last Activity. Sort order is lastUpdated descending with alphabetical slug as tiebreaker. Progress shows completed/total count only during implement phase; all other phases show a dash. lastUpdated is read directly from manifest JSON.

## Rationale
lastUpdated from the manifest provides a reliable activity timestamp without parsing run logs or file modification times.
