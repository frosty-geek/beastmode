# Manifest Redesign

## Context
The manifest originally lived at `state/plan/*.manifest.json` on the feature branch, mixing content concerns (architectural decisions) with pipeline state. It was committed and mutated by both skills and CLI.

## Decision
Manifest lives at `.beastmode/state/<slug>/manifest.json`, gitignored and local-only. Managed through two modules: manifest-store.ts (filesystem boundary, exports get/list/save/create/validate and all manifest types) and manifest.ts (pure state machine with 10 functions: enrich, advancePhase, regressPhase, markFeature, cancel, setGitHubEpic, setFeatureGitHubIssue, deriveNextAction, checkBlocked, shouldAdvance -- no fs imports, all immutable). Schema is single PipelineManifest type: slug, phase, features array (slug, status, plan path, optional github block), artifact references, worktree info, optional github block for epic, structured blocked field ({ gate, reason } | null). Legacy types EpicState, FeatureProgress, ScanResult deleted. CLI is the sole mutator through these modules. Old `pipeline/` path renamed to `state/`, old `state/plan/*.manifest.json` orphans deleted.

## Rationale
Gitignored local-only manifest eliminates merge conflicts in parallel worktrees. Pure pipeline schema removes architectural decisions that belonged in state artifacts. Single mutator (CLI) prevents race conditions and guarantees consistent state. Cold-start reconstruction enables recovery without the manifest file.
