# Sync Engine

## Context
Multiple phase checkpoints needed GitHub sync (labels, issues, project board). The original approach used a shared skill utility (`skills/_shared/github.md`) invoked from each checkpoint. This distributed responsibility across skills and made sync unreliable.

## Decision
Single CLI-owned TypeScript module exporting `syncGitHub(manifest, config)`. Called post-dispatch after every phase. Returns mutation objects instead of mutating manifests in-place -- caller applies mutations via manifest.ts pure functions and saves through manifest-store.ts. All `gh` CLI calls go through `Bun.spawn` with try/catch and warn-and-continue. Replaces `skills/_shared/github.md` entirely. Reconciliation logic: blast-replace `phase/*` labels, create-if-missing issues, set `status/*` labels, close completed features, close epic when done.

## Rationale
Moving sync to the CLI eliminates skill-level GitHub awareness, making skills pure content processors. A single entry point is testable with standard TypeScript tooling (mock `Bun.spawn`). Post-dispatch placement guarantees sync runs regardless of skill behavior.
