# Phase Output Contract

## Context
Skills previously mutated the manifest directly and ran GitHub sync inline. Decoupling skills from the manifest requires a structured communication channel from skills to the CLI.

## Decision
A Stop hook configured in `.claude/settings.json` auto-generates output.json from artifact YAML frontmatter. Skills write artifacts with structured frontmatter (phase, slug, status, etc.) to `artifacts/<phase>/`. The hook scans for matching artifacts, reads frontmatter, and writes `artifacts/<phase>/YYYY-MM-DD-<slug>.output.json` with the universal schema: `{ "status": "completed", "artifacts": { ... } }`. output.json is the sole completion signal, replacing .dispatch-done.json. Skills never write output.json directly -- the hook enforces the contract by infrastructure. The CLI provides a phase output reader that parses these files, handles missing/corrupt files gracefully, and extracts data needed to enrich the manifest. Output files are committed alongside skill artifacts as an audit trail.

## Rationale
Structured output files give the CLI a reliable contract to read without coupling skills to manifest internals. Committed output files serve as an audit trail. Graceful handling of missing/corrupt files ensures the pipeline never blocks on malformed skill output.
