# Implement Context

## Agents
- NEVER stash, switch branches, or modify worktrees without explicit user request
- ALWAYS verify worktree context before modifying files
- NEVER guess file paths — verify they exist first
- Agents commit per task on the impl branch (`impl/<slug>--<feature-name>`) — never on the worktree branch
- Agent roles: implementer (TDD execution), spec-reviewer (trust-nothing verification), quality-reviewer (self-contained quality checklist), plan-integration-tester (BDD specialist, spawned by plan skill) — all peers in `plugin/agents/`, all use four-status protocol
- ALWAYS add new worktree functions to all mock objects in tests — mock gaps cause test failures discovered only after implementation is complete
- NEVER use Bun `mock.module()` for modules shared across test files — it pollutes the module registry globally within a test run; use dependency injection or per-file mock objects instead
- ALWAYS grep for all mock sites of a module when adding new exports — mocks in unrelated test files break silently until the full suite runs
- ALWAYS include Cucumber step definition files (`*.steps.ts`) in migration scope analysis — they import module paths at runtime (e.g., `require('../manifest/store.js')`) that differ from TypeScript source import paths, making them invisible to TypeScript-import grep patterns
- Four-status model: DONE, DONE_WITH_CONCERNS, NEEDS_CONTEXT, BLOCKED — replaces three-tier deviation system
- ALWAYS enforce per-task dispatch for implementation agents — agents that batch all tasks into a single dispatch bypass the spec-review and quality-review pipeline, even if the resulting code passes tests; the review pipeline is a quality gate, not optional optimization

## Testing
- ALWAYS verify L2 files contain project-specific content, not placeholder patterns
- NEVER skip brownfield verification after init
- Critical paths: brownfield execution, parallel agent spawning, content merge, atomic file writes

## GitHub Integration
- ALWAYS gate GitHub sync on `github.enabled` in config.yaml — skip entirely when false or missing
- ALWAYS use warn-and-continue for gh CLI calls — print warning, skip failed op, never block local workflow
- Store JSON is the local authority; GitHub is a synced mirror updated only at checkpoint boundaries
- ALWAYS use `_shared/github.md` for all GitHub operations — never inline gh CLI logic
- Label taxonomy: 12 labels across type (2), phase (7), status (3) — status/review and gate/awaiting-approval removed
- Epic lifecycle: created at design checkpoint, phase-advanced at each subsequent checkpoint, closed at release with closing comment
- Feature lifecycle: created as sub-issues at plan checkpoint, set in-progress at implement prime, closed at implement checkpoint
- ALWAYS use presence-based rendering for issue body sections — present field = render section, absent field = omit, no phase-conditional logic in body-format.ts
- ALWAYS extract artifact content at sync time via section-extractor — never store extracted PRD/plan content in the manifest
- ALWAYS use `manifest.epic` (human-readable name) for epic issue titles — not hex slugs; feature titles use `{epic}: {feature}` format
- ALWAYS push branches and tags upstream after every phase checkpoint — pure git operations, not gated on `github.enabled`
- ALWAYS amend all commits since last phase tag with issue refs before push — range-based rebase, no force-push needed from CLI
- ALWAYS link branches to issues via `createLinkedBranch` GraphQL — gated on `github.enabled`, warn-and-continue
- ALWAYS add Bun global mocks (CryptoHasher, spawnSync) to integration tests that exercise sync engine code — vitest runs in Node mode where `globalThis.Bun` is undefined; the sync engine's `hashBody()` silently catches the ReferenceError, causing body updates to silently skip
- ALWAYS store bare filenames (no directory prefix, no absolute path) in epic/feature store fields for artifact paths — readers prefix the known artifact directory at read time using `basename(storedPath)` + `join(projectRoot, ".beastmode", "artifacts", "<phase>")`. This tolerates absolute worktree paths, repo-relative paths, and bare filenames equally with no store migration needed
- ALWAYS scope additive tasks (logging-only, metrics-only) with explicit "DO NOT change existing logic" guards in the task spec — agents drift into fixing adjacent code when they encounter it; the task must make the boundary explicit
- ALWAYS add unused-import check to the quality-reviewer checklist for new test files — TypeScript test files routinely accumulate unused imports (type imports, helper imports) that fail the type gate at validate; catching them at review is cheaper than validate fixup
- ALWAYS gate sync artifact reads on `isPhaseAtOrPast(epic.phase, threshold)` — skip `readPrdSections` when phase has not yet passed `design`, skip plan file reads when phase has not yet passed `plan`; gates log at `debug` level; prevents expected file-not-found conditions from producing WARN output
- ALWAYS use `logger.child({ phase: epic.phase })` at the sync entry point — propagates phase context to all downstream log calls automatically; prefer child logger over per-call context injection
- ALWAYS update existing sync tests to use post-threshold phases when adding phase gates — tests that exercise "warn on missing artifact" paths fail silently once a gate is added if they still use a pre-threshold phase

## State Scanning
- ALWAYS discover epics from store entities — never from design files or date heuristics
- Scan store.listEpics() — enrichment via XState machine snapshots
- ALWAYS derive phase from the store epic state — no filesystem marker sniffing
- Status table: Epic, Phase, Progress, Blocked, Last Activity
- Next action: fan-out at implement, single dispatch for all other phases, null for done epics

## Pipeline Machine
- Two XState v5 machines in cli/src/pipeline-machine/: epicMachine (7 states) and featureMachine (3 states)
1. ALWAYS use the setup() API — declare guards, actions, and actors in setup() before createMachine()
2. ALWAYS place assign() calls inside setup() actions with pure compute functions in actions.ts — XState v5.30 requires this for type inference
3. Every state node declares meta.dispatchType (single/fan-out/skip) — watch loop reads dispatch from state metadata
4. Services use fromPromise with injectable functions — machine stays decoupled from I/O
5. Guards are standalone pure functions checked against event payloads, not external state
6. CANCEL event must be valid from every non-terminal epic state
7. Persist action accumulates state in memory only — no disk writes during machine transitions, single `store.save()` at end of dispatch
8. REGRESS event replaces VALIDATE_FAILED — generic regression from any non-terminal state to any earlier phase except design, with full feature reset when regressing to or past implement

## Per-Session Map Lifecycle
- ALWAYS add cleanup for new per-session Maps in all completion AND abort paths -- leaked Map entries accumulate across the watch loop's lifetime
- ALWAYS use an explicit bridging Map when external APIs (iTerm2 pane IDs) and internal APIs (dispatch session IDs) use different ID namespaces -- ambiguous keying causes silent lookup failures
- ALWAYS use snapshot-diff pattern (capture IDs before, compare after) when detecting side effects of a black-box call on a mutable collection

## BDD Loop
- Write Plan generates Task 0 (integration test from Gherkin) as first task — RED state before implementation
- After all tasks complete, integration test is re-run — expects GREEN
- On failure: analyze output, identify responsible task, re-dispatch with failure context
- BDD verification escalation: independent from per-task escalation, same model ladder (haiku→sonnet→opus), 6 total retries
- Convention-based test discovery: file naming (`<feature>.integration.test.ts`), tags (`@<epic>`), describe blocks — no config file
- ALWAYS skip BDD verification if no Integration Test Scenarios section in feature plan
- ALWAYS skip BDD verification when the target system is a markdown instruction file with no executable step definitions — the `.feature` file documents the behavioral contract declaratively but there is nothing runnable; record the skip reason explicitly in the implement report so it is not confused with missing coverage

## Write Plan
- Write Plan replaces the implicit Decompose step — produces `.tasks.md` with header, file structure, and TDD task definitions before dispatch begins
- `.tasks.md` uses checkbox tracking (`- [ ]`/`- [x]`) for cross-session resume — no separate .tasks.json
- No YAML frontmatter in .tasks.md — prevents the stop hook from generating a spurious output.json
- Self-review pass after writing: spec coverage against feature plan, placeholder scan (TBD/TODO/ellipsis), type/name consistency check
- ALWAYS produce complete code in every step — no placeholders, no "add appropriate handling", no "similar to Task N"
- ALWAYS duplicate context from feature plan into .tasks.md header — makes the document self-contained for agents
- ALWAYS author wiring task implementations from current source on the worktree branch — plan artifact descriptions become stale as parallel waves complete; source is the ground truth for type signatures, import paths, and component props
- ALWAYS match the test runner to the target runtime in Write Plan tasks — `node:test` for plain Node.js modules (`*.mjs`), vitest for Bun/TypeScript modules (`*.ts`) — mixing runners with incompatible module systems causes silent import failures

## Agent Review Pipeline
- Three dedicated agent files: implementer.md (TDD), spec-reviewer.md (trust-nothing verification), quality-reviewer.md (self-contained checklist)
- Four-status model replaces three-tier deviations: DONE, DONE_WITH_CONCERNS, NEEDS_CONTEXT, BLOCKED
- Two-stage ordered review: spec compliance must pass before quality review runs
- Review retry loop: max 2 attempts before marking task as blocked and escalating to user
- NEVER trust the implementer's report — spec reviewer reads actual code independently

context/implement/agent-review-pipeline.md

## Model Escalation
- Three-tier ladder: haiku -> sonnet -> opus — implementer agents only, reviewers stay on default model
- Per-task reset: each new task starts at haiku regardless of prior task's final tier
- 2 retries per tier, max 6 total attempts per task before BLOCKED
- Escalation triggers: implementer BLOCKED (after tier retry exhaustion), quality NOT_APPROVED Critical/Important (after review-fix cycle exhaustion at tier)
- Non-triggers: NEEDS_CONTEXT, spec review FAIL, quality NOT_APPROVED Minor — these are context/requirement issues, not model capability
- Implementation report shows model tier per completed task and escalation count in status summary

context/implement/agent-review-pipeline.md

## Branch Isolation
- CLI creates `impl/<slug>--<feature-name>` branch before dispatch; agents commit per task on the impl branch
- ALWAYS verify the correct impl branch (`impl/<slug>--<feature-name>`) is checked out before writing the Write Plan — parallel wave execution leaves the prior feature's impl branch checked out; writing tasks on the wrong branch silently contaminates an adjacent feature's history
- ALWAYS verify the correct impl branch is still checked out immediately before each agent task commit — linter hooks and parallel wave completions can silently switch branches between tasks
- ALWAYS verify branch identity between sequential feature dispatches within the same session, not just at wave boundaries -- sequential features can inherit the prior feature's impl branch when branch creation/checkout is skipped or fails silently
- Checkpoint rebases impl branch onto worktree branch — fast-forward on success, conflict resolution agent on failure
- Max 2 conflict resolution attempts before aborting and reporting to user
- Resume model: first unchecked task in .tasks.md; prior tasks have commits on impl branch
- Subagent Safety: agents commit on impl branch only, never on worktree branch
- WHEN an impl branch is irrecoverable (contaminated commits, unresolvable rebases across multiple attempts), create a new impl branch with a retry suffix (`impl/<slug>--<feature>-fac2`, `-fac3`, etc.) and restart dispatch from the first unchecked task — preserve integration test file and Write Plan from the original attempt
