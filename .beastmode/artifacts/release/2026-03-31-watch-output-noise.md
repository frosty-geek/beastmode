# Release: watch-output-noise

**Bump:** minor
**Date:** 2026-03-31

## Highlights

Replaces 70 ad-hoc `console.log`/`console.error` calls across 13 CLI files with a centralized, verbosity-gated logger. Output is quiet by default — only state transitions and errors. Stack `-v` flags to drill into details when debugging.

## Features

- New `createLogger(verbosity, slug)` factory in `cli/src/logger.ts` with level-gated methods: `log()` (L0), `detail()` (L1), `debug()` (L2), `trace()` (L3), `warn()`/`error()` (stderr)
- `-v`/`-vv`/`-vvv` flag parsing on all CLI commands (watch, phase, cancel, status)
- Full call-site migration: all 70 `console.log`/`console.error` calls replaced with logger equivalents
- Consistent `HH:MM:SS slug: message` output format across all commands
- stderr/stdout split: warn/error always write to stderr, info/debug to stdout

## Fixes

- Restored feature-isolation guards removed during call-site migration (test regressions from missing guards)
