# Release: file-permission-hooks

**Version:** v0.83.0
**Date:** 2026-04-04

## Highlights

Adds a file-permission system that generates Claude Code hooks from declarative config, controlling which files each phase can touch. Includes permission logging for Write/Edit operations and full integration test coverage.

## Features

- Config parsing for `file-permissions` section with category prose getter
- Seed `file-permissions` in init template
- Hook builders and prompt constructor for permission enforcement
- Integration with watch, phase, and pipeline runner dispatch
- Lifecycle and coexistence tests for hook management
- Integration test suite with cucumber scenarios (config parsing, hook generation, decision logging, lifecycle)
- Write/Edit log entry detection and formatting
- Unified PostToolUse event routing for file permission logging

## Fixes

- Atomic clean write and removal of type casts in hook builders
- Index signature for TypeScript compatibility in config types
- Mock module removal to prevent cross-file test pollution
