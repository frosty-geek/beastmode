# Release: skill-cleanup

**Bump:** patch
**Date:** 2026-03-31

## Highlights

Removes dead shared files, eliminates redundant persona imports from all 5 skills, merges persona context-awareness into BEASTMODE.md, and flattens `_shared/` by moving `task-runner.md` to the skills root.

## Chores

- Delete 3 dead shared files: `persona.md`, `0-prime-template.md`, `3-checkpoint-template.md`
- Remove `@../_shared/persona.md` import from all 5 skill prime phases
- Remove dangling `@../_shared/retro.md` import from design checkpoint
- Merge persona context-awareness and skill-announce sections into BEASTMODE.md
- Move `task-runner.md` from `skills/_shared/` to `skills/` root
- Update all 5 SKILL.md task-runner import paths
- Delete now-empty `skills/_shared/` directory
