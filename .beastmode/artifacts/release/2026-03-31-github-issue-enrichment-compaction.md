# Context Tree Compaction Report

## Staleness Check
### Removed
- `.beastmode/context/implement/state-scanning/phase-derivation.md` — referenced deleted `manifest.phases` map and `EpicState` type; algorithm replaced by `PipelineManifest.phase` field
- `.beastmode/context/implement/state-scanning/epic-discovery.md` — referenced deleted `state/plan/` and `pipeline/` directories; discovery rewritten to use `manifest-store.ts`
- `.beastmode/context/implement/state-scanning/next-action-derivation.md` — described deleted `deriveNextAction()` function; replaced by pipeline machine dispatch metadata

### Flagged for Review
- `.beastmode/context/implement/pipeline-machine/assign-separation-pattern.md` — references machine definition artifact that may not exist; XState v5.30 assign() pattern rationale may still apply independently
- `.beastmode/context/implement/pipeline-machine/service-injection.md` — references machine definition artifact; service injection pattern validity unclear without referent
- `.beastmode/context/plan/github-integration/shared-utility.md` — title mismatch ("Sync Engine"); skills/_shared/github.md deleted as intended; CLI sync pattern is valid
- `.beastmode/context/release/release-process/release-rollup.md` — source references PRODUCT.md which doesn't exist; rollup strategy may be obsolete
- `.beastmode/context/implement/github-integration/api-boundary.md` — references deleted `_shared/github.md`; centralization principle still valid but mechanism moved to CLI
- `.beastmode/context/implement/github-integration/checkpoint-sync-pattern.md` — replaced by CLI post-dispatch sync; parent L2 also stale
- `.beastmode/context/implement/state-scanning/status-display.md` — partially stale references (`state/status.yaml`, `Justfile watch-status`) mixed with still-accurate content

## Restatement Scan
### Removed
- `.beastmode/context/design/architecture/knowledge-hierarchy.md` — pure restatement of parent L2: 4-level hierarchy, standardized format, L0 scope limits, structural invariants all covered

- `.beastmode/context/design/architecture/write-protection.md` — pure restatement of parent L2: artifact-only writes, retro/compaction gatekeeping, exemptions all covered
- `.beastmode/context/design/cli/recovery-model.md` — pure restatement of parent L2: stateless recovery model already specified
- `.beastmode/context/design/phase-transitions/phase-mapping.md` — pure restatement of parent L2: linear order and namespaced gates already specified
- `.beastmode/context/design/product/vision-and-goals.md` — pure restatement of parent L2: design-before-code, persistence, self-improvement, hierarchy all covered

- `.beastmode/context/design/tech-stack/dependencies.md` — pure restatement of parent L2: all dependencies listed identically
- `.beastmode/context/design/release-workflow/merge-strategy.md` — pure restatement of parent L2: squash, archives, interactive options all covered
- `.beastmode/context/design/release-workflow/changelog-generation.md` — pure restatement of parent L2: categorization, format, placement all covered
- `.beastmode/context/design/release-workflow/version-detection.md` — pure restatement of parent L2: conventional commits, plugin.json source, file bumps all covered
- `.beastmode/context/design/task-runner/execution-model.md` — pure restatement of parent L2: depth-first, TodoWrite, 2-retry limit all covered
- `.beastmode/context/design/orchestration/execution-model.md` — pure restatement of parent L2: watch, event-driven re-scan, poll interval, no cap all covered
- `.beastmode/context/design/state-scanner/gate-detection.md` — pure restatement of parent L2: reactive blocking already specified
- `.beastmode/context/design/github-state-model/issue-hierarchy.md` — pure restatement of parent L2: two-level Epic > Feature with type labels already specified
- `.beastmode/context/design/github-state-model/migration-strategy.md` — pure restatement of parent L2: clean-cut migration already covered
- `.beastmode/context/implement/agents/git-workflow.md` — pure restatement of parent L2 agents.md "Git Workflow" section

- `.beastmode/context/implement/agents/safety-rules.md` — pure restatement of parent L2 agents.md "Safety Rules" section
- `.beastmode/context/plan/conventions/anti-patterns.md` — pure restatement of parent L2 conventions.md; constraints already listed
- `.beastmode/context/plan/conventions/branch-naming.md` — pure restatement of parent L2 conventions.md "Branch Naming" section
- `.beastmode/context/plan/conventions/context-doc-format.md` — pure restatement of parent L2 conventions.md; format rules already covered
- `.beastmode/context/plan/conventions/file-naming.md` — pure restatement of parent L2 conventions.md "File Naming" section
- `.beastmode/context/plan/conventions/skill-definitions.md` — pure restatement of parent L2 conventions.md; skill anatomy already covered
