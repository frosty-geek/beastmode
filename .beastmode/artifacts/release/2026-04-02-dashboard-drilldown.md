# Release: dashboard-drilldown

**Bump:** minor
**Date:** 2026-04-02

## Highlights

Adds k9s-style push/pop drill-down navigation to the beastmode dashboard with live SDK streaming. Three views (Epic List, Feature List, Agent Log) form a view stack with breadcrumb navigation, context-sensitive key hints, and ring-buffered session history.

## Features

- View stack with push/pop navigation: Epic List → Feature List → Agent Log (enter to drill, escape to pop)
- Breadcrumb bar showing current position in the view stack
- Context-sensitive key hints bar per view type
- SDK dispatch refactored from fire-and-forget to async generator iteration with EventEmitter
- Structured message mapper converting SDKMessage types to terminal-friendly log entries (text deltas, tool call one-liners)
- Ring buffer per dispatched session (~100 entries) — history available immediately on navigation
- Dashboard forces SDK dispatch strategy at runtime
