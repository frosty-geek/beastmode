# Release: github-sync-again

**Bump:** minor
**Date:** 2026-04-05

## Highlights

Adds retry queue and reconciliation loop to the GitHub sync engine — failed operations now queue with exponential backoff, and a periodic reconciliation pass detects and repairs drift between local state and GitHub.

## Features

- Integrate reconciliation pass into watch loop tick
- Add reconciliation engine with bootstrap and queue drain
- Enqueue failed ops in sync engine error paths
- Add retry-queue data model and pure functions
- enqueuePendingOp, drainPendingOps, resolvePendingOp
- PendingOp types, SyncRef extension, backoff calculation

## Fixes

- Add Bun global mocks to integration test
- Remove unused imports and parameters from retry queue
- Remove unused loadSyncRefs import from integration test
- Use epic-prefixed titles for stub issues
- Map store status to phase, build artifacts from flat fields
