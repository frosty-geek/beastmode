# Release: exhaustive-sweep

**Version:** v0.61.0
**Date:** 2026-04-03

## Highlights

Replaces the opt-in "3 more or satisfied?" gray area continuation in the design skill with an auto-continuation loop that exhaustively surfaces all ambiguity until none remain, with an explicit "Skip" escape hatch.

## Features

- Auto-continue gray area sweep until 0 gray areas remain (no more opt-in continuation)
- "Skip — move to validation" option in every batch for explicit user escape
- Skip precedence: selecting Skip alongside gray areas exits immediately
- Session-scoped deduplication prevents re-surfacing resolved gray areas
- Partial batches (1-2 items) presented when fewer than 3 remain
- Express path inherits the same exhaustive sweep behavior
