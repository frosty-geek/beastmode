# Release: context-tree-compaction

**Bump:** minor
**Date:** 2026-03-31

## Highlights

Adds prevention and cleanup mechanisms for context tree bloat. Retro walkers now skip L3 records that merely restate their parent L2, and a new compaction agent audits the full tree — removing stale records, folding restatements, and detecting L0 promotion candidates.

## Features

- Retro value-add gate in both walkers (retro-context, retro-meta) — four-criteria check prevents redundant L3 creation at the source
- Compaction agent (`agents/compaction.md`) — three-step algorithm: staleness removal, restatement folding, L0 promotion detection
- `beastmode compact` CLI command — on-demand context tree audit, always runs regardless of release cadence
- Release compaction integration — automatic compaction every 5 releases, runs before retro in checkpoint phase

## Chores
