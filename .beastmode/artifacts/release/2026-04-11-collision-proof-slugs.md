# Release: collision-proof-slugs

**Bump:** minor
**Date:** 2026-04-11

## Highlights

Epic and feature slugs now embed unique ID suffixes, making slug collisions structurally impossible. CLI users can type the human-readable prefix and have it resolve to the full slug via opt-in prefix matching.

## Features

- Derive epic slugs as `slugify(name)-{4-hex-chars}` from entity ID, making them collision-proof
- Derive feature slugs as `slugify(name)-{ordinal}` from feature ID suffix, replacing hash-based deduplication
- Add opt-in prefix matching to `resolveIdentifier()` for CLI ergonomics (exact match still takes priority)
- Wire `allowPrefix` into `phaseCommand()` and `cancelEpic()` CLI entry points
- Rewrite `reconcileDesign()` to update slug in-place via `updateEpic()`, preserving entity ID stability
- Rename git tags from old slug to new slug during design reconciliation
- Remove slug immutability guard from `updateEpic()` to enable design-phase slug mutation
- Delete dead code: `hashId()`, `deduplicateSlug()`, and `collectSlugs()`

## Fixes

- Restore `slug?` optional parameter in store signatures for backward compatibility with old-format slugs
- Rename design artifact to match epic name convention
