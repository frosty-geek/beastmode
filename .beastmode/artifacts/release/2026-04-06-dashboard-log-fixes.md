# Release: dashboard-log-fixes

**Bump:** minor
**Date:** 2026-04-06

## Highlights

Fixes dashboard logging quality across three fronts: CLI root entries now respect the verbosity filter, lifecycle events route to the correct log with proper severity levels, and the running plugin version renders below the clock in the header.

## Features

- feat(cli-verbosity-filter): filter CLI root entries through shouldShowEntry
- feat(event-routing-and-levels): add optional level field to LogEntry
- feat(event-routing-and-levels): set level and sessionId in lifecycleToLogEntry
- feat(event-routing-and-levels): remove dual-write, set correct log levels
- feat(version-display): capture version from started event in App state
- feat(version-display): render version below clock in header

## Docs

- docs(cli-verbosity-filter): remove stale CLI-passthrough comment
