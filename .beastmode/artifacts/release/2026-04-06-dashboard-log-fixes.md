# Release: dashboard-log-fixes

**Bump:** minor
**Date:** 2026-04-06

## Highlights

Renames the CLI root node to SYSTEM with hierarchical tree prefixes, adds dynamic status badges to epic and feature nodes, fixes event routing to use proper log levels, and wires up missing dashboard state connections (enrichedEpics, maxVisibleLines, session splitting).

## Features

- Rename CLI root node to SYSTEM with hierarchical tree prefix
- Use session phase for dynamic epic node status, in-progress badges for features

## Fixes

- Classify watch-loop started as debug level
- Prefer explicit level field in entryTypeToLevel mapping
- Pass enrichedEpics to useDashboardTreeState
- Compute maxVisibleLines from terminal rows
- Split session-started into info + debug entries
- Remove unused SystemEntry import

## Docs

- Update CLI references to SYSTEM in comments
