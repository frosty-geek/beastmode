# Release: Dashboard Graceful Exit

**Bump:** minor
**Date:** 2026-04-12

## Highlights

Fixes the dashboard hang-on-exit bug by properly draining all four categories of async work that hold the Bun event loop open. The dashboard now exits cleanly within seconds when the user presses `q` or Ctrl+C, with verbose shutdown logging showing progress.

## Features

- Add AbortSignal support to `gh()` subprocess helper — kills spawned Bun processes on abort
- Thread AbortSignal through `reconcileGitHub()` callchain — in-flight GitHub API calls cancelled on exit
- Per-tick AbortController lifecycle on WatchLoop — `stop()` aborts current tick, verbose shutdown logging, reduced waitAll timeout from 30s to 5s, listener cleanup via `removeAllListeners()`, `createTag` guard against post-shutdown spawns
- Await `proc.exited` in `fetchGitStatus` — releases git subprocess handles to unblock event loop drain
