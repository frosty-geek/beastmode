## Problem Statement

The watch loop's GitHub sync layer logs `gh api failed (exit 1): gh: Not Found (HTTP 404)` with no indication of which API endpoint was called or which epic triggered it. In a parallel pipeline running 3+ epics, this makes diagnosis impossible.

## Solution

Thread the existing logger (which carries epic context like `watch:hitl-config`) through all `gh.ts` helper functions, and improve the error message to include the actual API endpoint instead of just the command verb.

## User Stories

1. As a pipeline operator, I want `gh api` errors to show the full endpoint path (e.g., `repos/.../issues/5/sub_issues`), so that I can identify which API call failed without guessing.
2. As a pipeline operator, I want `gh api` errors to include the epic slug in the log prefix, so that I can correlate failures to specific epics in a parallel pipeline.
3. As a pipeline operator, I want all GitHub sync warnings to flow through the same logger hierarchy, so that I get consistent log formatting across the entire sync path.

## Implementation Decisions

- Add `logger?: Logger` to the opts parameter of all 11 `gh*` helper functions in `gh.ts` (`ghLabelCreate`, `ghIssueEdit`, `ghIssueCreate`, `ghIssueClose`, `ghIssueReopen`, `ghIssueState`, `ghIssueLabels`, `ghProjectItemAdd`, `ghProjectSetField`, `ghProjectItemDelete`, `ghSubIssueAdd`)
- Each `gh*` function passes its logger through to the inner `gh()` call
- Change the error message in `gh()` from `gh ${args[0]} failed` to `gh ${args.slice(0, 2).join(" ")} failed` — shows verb + endpoint for `gh api` calls, and verb + subcommand for others
- Add `logger?: Logger` parameter to `syncGitHub()` in `github-sync.ts`
- Thread the logger from `syncGitHub()` to every `gh*` call site within `github-sync.ts`
- `syncGitHubForEpic()` already creates a logger with epic context (`watch:<epicSlug>`) — pass it to `syncGitHub()`
- No new abstractions — pure plumbing through existing opts patterns

## Testing Decisions

- Existing tests in `gh.test.ts` and `github-sync.test.ts` cover the sync behavior — this change is plumbing that doesn't alter control flow
- No new tests required; existing tests should pass without modification since `logger` is optional

## Out of Scope

- GraphQL query/mutation name extraction in error messages
- Logger threading for `setup-github.md` callers (only the watch loop sync path)
- Retry logic or error recovery for 404s
- Structured error types or error codes
