## Problem Statement

The implement skill's task decomposition step is a black box. It produces thin `.tasks.json` entries without complete code, file structure mapping, TDD discipline, or review gates. Subagents receive vague instructions, deviate from intent, and produce work that requires extensive post-hoc correction. There is no inspection point between "plan says what to build" and "agent is writing code." The current three-tier deviation system (auto-fix, blocking, architectural) conflates agent capability problems with plan quality problems.

## Solution

Replace the implicit Decompose step (Execute step 0) with a visible Write Plan step that produces a comprehensive, inspectable `.tasks.md` document — superpowers-style — with file structure mapping, complete code blocks, TDD red-green cycles, exact commands, and a strict no-placeholder rule. Introduce three dedicated Claude Code agent files: an implementer agent with TDD methodology and testing anti-patterns baked in, a spec compliance reviewer that verifies by reading code (not trusting reports), and a self-contained code quality reviewer. Add isolated implementation branches per feature — CLI creates `feature/<slug>/<feature-name>`, agents commit per task on that branch, checkpoint rebases back to the worktree branch. Drop parallel dispatch for now; sequential dispatch only.

## User Stories

1. As a skill author, I want the implement skill to produce a detailed, inspectable task breakdown document before any code is written, so that I can verify the implementation approach matches the feature plan.
2. As a skill author, I want implementer agents to follow strict TDD (red-green-refactor with mandatory failure verification), so that every piece of production code has a proven test.
3. As a skill author, I want a spec compliance reviewer to independently verify each task's output by reading actual code — not trusting the implementer's report — so that missing, extra, or misunderstood requirements are caught before proceeding.
4. As a skill author, I want a code quality reviewer to check implementation quality (responsibility, decomposition, plan adherence, naming, maintainability) after spec compliance passes, so that review is two-stage and ordered.
5. As a skill author, I want each feature implementation to run on an isolated branch (`feature/<slug>/<feature-name>`) with per-task commits, so that the worktree branch stays clean and resume is natural (find first unchecked task).
6. As a skill author, I want checkpoint to rebase the impl branch back to the worktree branch — with an auto-retry conflict resolution agent on failure — so that parallel feature implementations merge cleanly.

## Implementation Decisions

### Write Plan (Execute Step 0, replaces Decompose)

- Produces `.beastmode/artifacts/implement/YYYY-MM-DD-<epic>-<feature>.tasks.md`
- Full superpowers-style plan document with:
  - **Header**: goal, architecture, tech stack — duplicated from the feature plan (not referenced)
  - **File Structure section**: every file to be created/modified with its responsibility, listed before task definitions — this is where decomposition decisions get locked in
  - **Bite-sized tasks**: each step is one action (2-5 minutes), following TDD red-green-refactor
  - **Complete code**: every step contains actual code, actual commands, actual assertions
  - **Exact commands** with expected output for every verification step
- **No-placeholder rule**: TBD, TODO, "add appropriate error handling", "similar to Task N" are plan failures — self-review scans for violations
- **Self-review pass** after writing: spec coverage check against feature plan, placeholder scan, type/name consistency check across tasks — fix inline before dispatch
- **No YAML frontmatter** in the .tasks.md — the stop hook (`cli/src/hooks/generate-output.ts`) scans `artifacts/<phase>/` for `.md` files with frontmatter and generates `.output.json`. The `.tasks.md` must not have frontmatter to avoid generating a spurious output.json (the deviation log artifact is the real completion signal)
- **Checkbox tracking** (`- [ ]` / `- [x]`) in the .tasks.md for cross-session resume — no separate .tasks.json
- **No approval gate** — Write Plan flows straight into dispatch
- **No scope check** — trust /plan's scoping
- **Task-level waves only** — no feature-level waves carried forward from /plan

### Task Structure in .tasks.md

Each task follows this structure:

```
### Task N: [Component Name]

**Wave:** [integer, default 1]
**Depends on:** [Task references, or `-` if none]

**Files:**
- Create: `exact/path/to/file.ts`
- Modify: `exact/path/to/existing.ts:123-145`
- Test: `tests/exact/path/to/test.ts`

- [ ] **Step 1: Write the failing test**
[complete test code]

- [ ] **Step 2: Run test to verify it fails**
Run: `[exact command]`
Expected: FAIL with "[expected failure message]"

- [ ] **Step 3: Write minimal implementation**
[complete implementation code]

- [ ] **Step 4: Run test to verify it passes**
Run: `[exact command]`
Expected: PASS

- [ ] **Step 5: Commit**
```bash
git add [specific files]
git commit -m "feat(<feature>): [specific message]"
```
```

### Agent Architecture

Three dedicated Claude Code agent files in `.claude/agents/`:

**`implementer.md`** — Receives a single task with full text, context, and pre-read file contents. Implements following strict TDD:
- Red-green-refactor cycle mandatory for every task
- Iron law: no production code without a failing test first
- Testing anti-patterns baked in: never test mock behavior, never add test-only methods to production classes, never mock without understanding dependencies, never create incomplete mocks
- Code organization: follow plan's file structure, one responsibility per file, report DONE_WITH_CONCERNS if files grow beyond plan's intent
- Escalation: always OK to stop and say "this is too hard for me" — BLOCKED or NEEDS_CONTEXT
- Self-review before reporting: completeness, quality, discipline, testing checklist
- Commits per task on the impl branch
- Reports one of four statuses: DONE, DONE_WITH_CONCERNS, BLOCKED, NEEDS_CONTEXT

**`spec-reviewer.md`** — Trust-nothing spec compliance verification:
- Receives task requirements and implementer's report
- MUST verify everything independently by reading actual code
- Do not trust the report — implementer may be incomplete, inaccurate, or optimistic
- Checks: missing requirements, extra/unneeded work, misunderstandings
- Verify by reading code, not by trusting report
- Reports: ✅ Spec compliant or ❌ Issues found with file:line references

**`quality-reviewer.md`** — Self-contained code quality review:
- Only dispatched after spec compliance passes
- Receives implementer's report, task requirements, and commit diff (base SHA to head SHA)
- Self-contained checklist (no external review template dependency):
  - Does each file have one clear responsibility with a well-defined interface?
  - Are units decomposed so they can be understood and tested independently?
  - Does implementation follow the file structure from the plan?
  - Did this change create new files that are already large, or significantly grow existing files?
  - Are names clear and accurate?
  - Is the code clean and maintainable?
  - Are tests comprehensive and testing real behavior (not mock behavior)?
- Reports: Strengths, Issues (Critical/Important/Minor), Assessment (Approved / Not Approved)

### Controller Status Handling

Four agent statuses replace the three-tier deviation system:

- **DONE**: proceed to spec compliance review
- **DONE_WITH_CONCERNS**: read concerns — if correctness/scope, address before review; if observations, note and proceed to review
- **NEEDS_CONTEXT**: provide missing context and re-dispatch same agent
- **BLOCKED**: assess blocker — provide more context and re-dispatch, or break task into smaller pieces, or escalate to user if plan itself is wrong

Never ignore an escalation or force retry without changes.

### Review Model

Two-stage review after each task, ordered:

1. **Spec compliance review** — dispatch spec-reviewer agent — must pass before quality review
2. **Code quality review** — dispatch quality-reviewer agent — must pass before task is marked complete

When a reviewer finds issues:
- Same implementer agent fixes them (agent stays alive through review cycle)
- Reviewer re-reviews
- Loop until approved or max retries (2)
- After max retries: mark task as blocked, report to user

### Branch Model

- CLI creates `feature/<slug>/<feature-name>` branch from the worktree branch before dispatch
- Skill assumes the branch exists and is checked out
- Agents commit per task on this isolated branch
- No parallel dispatch — sequential only (parallel deferred as future optimization)

### Checkpoint Merge

- Checkpoint rebases the impl branch (`feature/<slug>/<feature-name>`) onto the worktree branch (`feature/<slug>`)
- On rebase failure (conflicts from parallel feature implementations): auto-retry with a conflict resolution agent
- Conflict resolution agent receives the conflict markers and attempts to resolve
- If resolution fails after 2 attempts: report to user with conflict details
- Deviation log committed on the worktree branch after successful rebase (same as current checkpoint behavior)

### Dispatch Model

- Sequential only — one agent at a time per impl branch
- Wave ordering respected: Wave 1 tasks complete before Wave 2
- Within a wave, tasks dispatched in order (no parallelism)
- Parallel dispatch deferred as a future optimization

## Testing Decisions

- Execute /implement on a real feature plan with 3+ tasks across 2+ waves
- Verify .tasks.md is produced with complete code, no placeholders
- Verify self-review catches a deliberately inserted placeholder
- Verify TDD cycle: agent writes failing test, verifies failure, implements, verifies pass
- Verify spec reviewer catches a deliberately missing requirement
- Verify quality reviewer catches a deliberately poor decomposition
- Verify per-task commits appear on the impl branch
- Verify checkpoint rebase succeeds with clean impl branch
- Verify checkbox tracking: kill session mid-implementation, restart, verify resume from first unchecked task
- Test with a feature plan that has a single task (edge case — no waves)

## Out of Scope

- Parallel dispatch within waves (deferred — future optimization)
- Feature-level wave ordering from /plan (task-level waves only)
- Model selection per task complexity (all agents use the same model for now)
- .tasks.json persistence format (replaced by .tasks.md checkbox tracking)
- Three-tier deviation system (replaced by four superpowers statuses)
- Approval gate between Write Plan and dispatch
- Scope check in Write Plan (trust /plan's scoping)

## Further Notes

- The superpowers skill includes a "model selection" section recommending cheaper models for mechanical tasks. This is a good future optimization but out of scope for v3.
- The current parallel-safe flag analysis (file overlap check per wave) becomes irrelevant with sequential dispatch but should be preserved in the task format for when parallel dispatch is added later.
- The impl branch model opens the door for `git bisect` per feature — each task commit is a known-good checkpoint.

## Deferred Ideas

- Parallel dispatch within waves with serialized commits or sub-branches per agent
- Model selection per task complexity (cheap for mechanical, capable for integration)
- Final code reviewer across all tasks after implementation completes (superpowers does this)
- Codebase map updates after implementation
- Per-task rollback via `git revert` on the impl branch
