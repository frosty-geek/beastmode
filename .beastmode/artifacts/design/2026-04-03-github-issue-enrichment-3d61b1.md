## Problem Statement

GitHub issues for epics and features are hollow shells. Epic bodies contain only a phase badge, one-line problem/solution text, and a feature checklist. Feature bodies contain only a description and epic back-reference. There is no PRD content, no user stories, no traceability to commits, branches, tags, or versions. After release, there is no way to discover what shipped, when, or how from the issue itself.

## Solution

Progressively enrich GitHub issue bodies with rich PRD content, user stories, artifact links, and full git traceability. The CLI reads artifact markdown files directly at sync time using a regex section splitter — no Stop hook changes. Bodies get richer as epics advance through phases: PRD content after design, plan artifact link after plan, version and merge commit after release. Feature issue bodies include their user story extracted from the feature plan file. On release, the epic body gets final links and a closing comment announces the release with version, tag, and merge commit.

## User Stories

1. As a developer browsing GitHub issues, I want epic bodies to include PRD summary, user stories, and implementation decisions, so that I can understand the feature without leaving GitHub.
2. As a developer browsing GitHub issues, I want feature bodies to include their user story from the plan, so that I know what each feature implements.
3. As a developer, I want epic issues to link to the full PRD (repo-relative path and GitHub permalink), so that I can access the complete design document.
4. As a developer, I want epic issues to show branch name, phase tags, release version, and merge commit link, so that I can trace code changes back to the feature.
5. As a developer, I want a closing comment on released epics with version number, release tag, and merge commit, so that release history is discoverable from the issue timeline.
6. As a developer, I want the epic body to be updated at each phase transition with newly available information, so that the issue always reflects the current state of the feature.
7. As a developer, I want the system to degrade gracefully when artifact paths are missing, so that GitHub sync never fails due to missing content.

## Implementation Decisions

- CLI reads artifact markdown directly at sync time for all content (PRD sections, user stories). The Stop hook and output.json schema remain unchanged.
- Regex section splitter on `## ` headings extracts named sections from PRD and plan artifacts. No markdown AST library needed — PRD template headings are controlled and predictable.
- Feature user stories are extracted from the feature plan `.md` file (path in `manifest.features[n].plan`), which already contains a `## User Stories` section mapped from the PRD by the plan skill.
- Git metadata (branch, phase tag SHAs, version, merge commit SHA) is read by the CLI directly from git state — `git rev-parse`, `git tag`, and `plugin.json`.
- Permalinks use the phase tag SHA (`beastmode/{slug}/{phase}`) as the commit anchor. Phase tags survive squash-merge because they reference the original commits, which remain reachable via the tag refs and archive tag.
- `body-format.ts` uses presence-based rendering: all new content fields are optional on `EpicBodyInput` and `FeatureBodyInput`. If a field is present, render it. If not, skip it. No phase-conditional logic in the formatter — the CLI decides what to provide.
- `EpicBodyInput` is extended with optional fields: `prdSections` (problem, solution, userStories, decisions), `artifactLinks` (per-phase repo paths and permalinks), `gitMetadata` (branch, phaseTags, version, mergeCommit).
- `FeatureBodyInput` is extended with optional `userStory` field (full text from plan file).
- Artifact path discovery uses `manifest.artifacts` first, falls back to scanning `artifacts/{phase}/` by slug glob, degrades gracefully to current minimal body if neither works.
- Progressive enrichment means one body update per phase transition (~5-7 API calls per epic lifetime). Existing `bodyHash` mechanism prevents redundant calls.
- On release: epic body is updated with version, release tag, and merge commit link. A separate closing comment is posted with a release summary. Both body update and comment happen in the same sync cycle.
- The `github-sync.ts` orchestrates artifact reads before calling body-format.ts — new helper functions read and parse artifact sections, resolve phase tag SHAs, and build permalink URLs.

## Testing Decisions

- Unit tests for `body-format.ts`: verify new optional fields produce correct markdown sections, verify presence-based rendering (missing fields produce no output, not empty sections), verify progressive enrichment at each phase.
- Unit tests for the regex section splitter: verify extraction of named sections from PRD and plan templates, verify handling of missing sections and malformed markdown.
- Integration tests extending `github-sync.test.ts`: verify the full sync flow with mock artifact files, verify graceful degradation when artifacts are missing, verify closing comment generation at release.
- Test patterns follow existing test structure in `cli/src/__tests__/`.

## Out of Scope

- Extending the Stop hook or output.json schema
- Storing PRD content or user stories in the manifest
- Full markdown AST parsing
- Plan task breakdown in epic body (sub-issues handle this)
- Feature-level traceability links (branch/tags apply at epic level)
- Bidirectional sync (GitHub remains a one-way mirror)

## Further Notes

- The plan skill already maps user stories to features and validates coverage. This design leverages that existing mapping.
- Phase tags (`beastmode/{slug}/{phase}`) and archive tags (created before squash-merge) ensure permalink durability even after branch deletion.
- The existing `bodyHash` check in `github-sync.ts` already handles update efficiency — no new caching mechanism needed.
