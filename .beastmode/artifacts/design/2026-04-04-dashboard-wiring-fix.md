## Problem Statement

The flashy-dashboard PRD (v0.81.0) specified a ThreePanelLayout with a nyan cat rainbow banner, inline panel titles, an OVERVIEW panel, and full terminal height. The components were implemented — `ThreePanelLayout.tsx`, `NyanBanner.tsx`, `nyan-colors.ts`, `OverviewPanel.tsx` — but `App.tsx` still renders `TwoColumnLayout`, which has none of these features. The dashboard shows a plain cyan "beastmode" text header, a two-column layout with "DETAILS" label, and no rainbow animation.

## Solution

Wire `ThreePanelLayout` into `App.tsx` as the active layout, verify end-to-end compliance with all five flashy-dashboard user stories, and delete the dead `TwoColumnLayout` code and its tests.

## User Stories

1. As a user, I want App.tsx to render ThreePanelLayout instead of TwoColumnLayout, so that the dashboard displays the nyan cat rainbow banner and k9s-style three-panel layout as designed.

2. As a user, I want all five flashy-dashboard PRD user stories verified end-to-end (rainbow banner cycling, 80ms tick, inline panel titles, static overview panel, full terminal height), so that the implementation matches the approved design.

3. As a user, I want TwoColumnLayout.tsx deleted after the switch, so that dead layout code doesn't accumulate in the codebase.

4. As a user, I want the TwoColumnLayout test file (`two-column-layout.test.ts`) deleted, so that tests for removed code don't linger.

5. As a user, I want the app-integration tests updated to reflect the ThreePanelLayout as the active layout, so that tests match reality.

## Implementation Decisions

- **Layout switch**: Replace `TwoColumnLayout` import and JSX in `App.tsx` with `ThreePanelLayout`. The prop interface is compatible — both accept `watchRunning`, `clock`, `epicsSlot`, `detailsSlot`, `logSlot`, `keyHints`, `isShuttingDown`, `cancelPrompt`. ThreePanelLayout additionally accepts `rows`.
- **rows prop**: Already computed in App.tsx via `useTerminalSize()` — just needs to be passed to ThreePanelLayout (TwoColumnLayout silently ignored it).
- **backgroundColor prop**: TwoColumnLayout passes `backgroundColor="#2d2d2d"` to PanelBox, but PanelBox's interface doesn't accept it. ThreePanelLayout doesn't pass it either. No action needed — the prop was always dead.
- **File deletions**: `TwoColumnLayout.tsx`, `__tests__/two-column-layout.test.ts`
- **Test updates**: `app-integration.test.ts` may reference TwoColumnLayout — update to ThreePanelLayout.
- **No component changes**: NyanBanner, nyan-colors, PanelBox, OverviewPanel, ThreePanelLayout all function correctly. The bug is purely a wiring issue in App.tsx.

## Testing Decisions

- Run existing `three-panel-layout.test.ts` to confirm it passes
- Run `app-integration.test.ts` after updating references
- Verify no remaining imports of TwoColumnLayout across the codebase
- Visual smoke test: run `beastmode dashboard` and confirm rainbow banner cycles, layout is three-panel, titles are inline, OVERVIEW label shows, terminal fills to full height

## Out of Scope

- Modifying ThreePanelLayout, NyanBanner, PanelBox, or OverviewPanel components
- Adding new features to the dashboard
- Changing the nyan color palette or animation timing
- Adding TwoColumnLayout as a user-selectable alternative

## Further Notes

- The root cause is a classic integration gap: component-level implementation was done, but the top-level wiring in App.tsx was not updated. This is a single-line category fix with cleanup.
