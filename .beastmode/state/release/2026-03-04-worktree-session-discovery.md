# Release v0.5.3

**Date:** 2026-03-04

## Highlights

Adds worktree discovery so phases can find and enter feature worktrees in new sessions without requiring the user to remember worktree paths.

## Features

- Add "Discover Feature" section to `_shared/worktree-manager.md` with 3-case resolution (argument, filesystem scan, zero-worktree guidance)
- Update plan, implement, and validate 0-prime phases to use discovery flow instead of hardcoded `feature="<feature-name>"`
- When no argument given with single worktree: auto-selects it
- When no argument given with multiple worktrees: lists and prompts user to pick
- When no argument given with zero worktrees: shows guidance to run /design

## Full Changelog

- `ed7aaf4` feat(worktree-session-discovery): worktree discovery for cross-session resume
