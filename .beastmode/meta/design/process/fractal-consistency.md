# Fractal Consistency

## Observation 1
### Context
During progressive-l1-docs design, 2026-03-04
### Observation
Fractal consistency beats special-casing. When a structural pattern works for one domain, apply it uniformly to all domains without exceptions.
### Rationale
Special-casing adds complexity without value

### Confidence
[HIGH] — promoted to SOP: "Mirror existing patterns before designing from scratch"

## Observation 2
### Context
During meta-hierarchy design, 2026-03-05
### Observation
Applying existing patterns to neglected domains reveals structural debt. Meta had flat L1 files while context had full L1/L2 hierarchy.
### Rationale
Structural consistency across domains enables better tooling

[HIGH] — promoted to SOP: "Mirror existing patterns before designing from scratch"

## Observation 3
### Context
During l2-domain-expansion design, 2026-03-06
### Observation
Session-seeded beats templates and stubs for L2 file creation. Seeding from the session that triggered the gap produces files with real content from day one.
### Rationale
The retro loop already produces real content — use it instead of generic templates

## Observation 4
### Context
During meta-retro-rework design, 2026-03-07
### Observation
Mirroring an existing walker as a design template constrains the design space productively. The remaining decisions were scoped narrowly.
### Rationale
Start from existing algorithms when building structurally analogous subsystems

### Confidence
[HIGH] — promoted to SOP: "Mirror existing patterns before designing from scratch"

## Observation 5
### Context
During hierarchy-format-v2 design, 2026-03-08
### Observation
Fractal format convergence (identical L1/L2 format for Meta and Context domains) was an explicit structural decision. User requested unified format across domains to enable uniform tooling.
### Rationale
Fractal consistency enables single retro walker to process both domains; supports future cross-domain analysis
### Source

### Confidence
[MEDIUM] — explicit user requirement, aligns with existing fractal consistency SOP
