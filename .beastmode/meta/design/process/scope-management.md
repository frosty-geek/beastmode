# Scope Management

## Observation 1
### Context
During design-v2 design, 2026-03-04
### Observation
Brevity vs structure trade-off. GSD's discuss-phase is 5x longer than beastmode's design. The extra length is structured step definitions. Beastmode's brevity is a strength, but some omissions lose substance.
### Rationale
Target: add structure without matching verbosity
### Source
state/design/2026-03-04-design-phase-v2.md
### Confidence
[LOW] — single comparison

## Observation 2
### Context
During progressive-l1-docs design, 2026-03-04
### Observation
User vision may need multiple rounds to formalize. The user had a clear directional vision but it took several iterative rounds to converge on the exact model.
### Rationale
Budget design sessions for convergence time
### Source
state/design/2026-03-04-progressive-l1-docs.md
### Confidence
[LOW] — single feature observation

## Observation 3
### Context
During meta-hierarchy design, 2026-03-05
### Observation
Deferred ideas should be challenged for inclusion. Auto-promotion was initially deferred but the user wanted it in scope. Deferral should be reserved for ideas requiring new components.
### Rationale
Include if it fits within the existing component model
### Source
state/design/2026-03-05-meta-hierarchy.md
### Confidence
[MEDIUM] — confirmed principle

## Observation 4
### Context
During meta-hierarchy design, 2026-03-05
### Observation
Three-category classification needs concrete definitions upfront. Splitting meta into SOPs/overrides/learnings required explicit definitions to prevent ambiguous routing.
### Rationale
Define each category with a one-liner and example before designing routing
### Source
state/design/2026-03-05-meta-hierarchy.md
### Confidence
[LOW] — superseded by two-domain model

## Observation 5
### Context
During dynamic-retro-walkers design, 2026-03-05
### Observation
Feature requests can generalize into architecture improvements. User started with "deferred ideas should bubble up" and pivoted to "the retro agents should be dynamic."
### Rationale
When a user pushes on mechanism, explore whether the system needs redesign
### Source

### Confidence
[LOW] — single feature observation

## Observation 6
### Context
During design-approval-summary design, 2026-03-05
### Observation
Users prefer concise approval views over verbose ones. For approval gates, default to executive summary — minimal information for go/no-go.
### Rationale
Less information at approval time reduces cognitive load
### Source
state/design/2026-03-05-design-approval-summary.md
### Confidence
[LOW] — single feature observation

## Observation 7
### Context
During dynamic-retro-walkers design, 2026-03-05
### Observation
Present trade-offs before recommendations. User pushed back on presenting recommendations upfront without showing the analysis path.
### Rationale
Show the trade-off matrix first, then recommend

### Confidence
[LOW] — single feature observation

## Observation 8
### Context
During l2-domain-expansion design, 2026-03-06
### Observation
Scope-limiting to the promotion mechanism was the right call. Research identified 20+ knowledge domains and 5 expansion directions. Locking scope kept the design tractable.
### Rationale
Documented deferred items with directional notes prevent contradictions
### Source
state/design/2026-03-06-l2-domain-expansion.md
### Confidence
[LOW] — single feature observation

## Observation 9
### Context
During meta-retro-rework design, 2026-03-07
### Observation
Replacing flat classification with hierarchical confidence enables graduation. New confidence-tagged records with promotion thresholds make graduation structural.
### Rationale
Model confidence accumulation explicitly rather than requiring manual category changes
### Source
state/design/2026-03-07-meta-retro-rework.md
### Confidence
[LOW] — first application

## Observation 10
### Context
During meta-retro-rework design, 2026-03-07
### Observation
Migration strategy for structural reworks should be per-instance, not per-pattern. Enumerating per-phase, per-file-type reveals gaps.
### Rationale
Follows "Walk every instance" SOP and validates the new structure
### Source
state/design/2026-03-07-meta-retro-rework.md
### Confidence
[LOW] — single application

## Observation 11
### Context
During init-l2-expansion design, 2026-03-08
### Observation
"Go broad, let retro prune" as a scope strategy. Instead of deferring uncertain domains, the design included all 17 L2 domains (Tier 1 + Tier 2 universal) with the explicit rationale that retro would prune empty L2s over time. This is proactive over-inclusion with a structural prune mechanism, rather than conservative deferral.
### Rationale
When a prune mechanism already exists (retro), over-inclusion is cheaper than under-inclusion — under-inclusion requires future expansion designs, over-inclusion just needs cleanup
### Source
state/design/2026-03-08-init-l2-expansion.md
### Confidence
[LOW] — first observation of this specific scope strategy (over-include with prune vs. defer)

## Observation 12
### Context
During github-phase-integration design, 2026-03-28
### Observation
When a design discovers that a prerequisite system doesn't exist (manifest system needed for GitHub integration), absorbing it into the current PRD scope rather than splitting into a separate design effort keeps the design coherent. The PRD explicitly noted "The manifest system is a prerequisite that doesn't exist yet. This PRD includes building it as part of the implementation, not as a separate effort."
### Rationale
Splitting a prerequisite into a separate design creates coordination overhead between two PRDs and risks the dependent design becoming stale while waiting. Absorption keeps the authority model and prerequisite in one coherent document.
### Source
state/design/2026-03-28-github-phase-integration.md
### Confidence
[LOW] — first observation of prerequisite-absorption as a scope strategy (related to Obs 3 challenge-deferrals and Obs 11 over-include-with-prune, but distinct: this is about missing dependencies, not optional features)

## Observation 13
### Context
During typescript-pipeline-orchestrator design, 2026-03-28
### Observation
When a new design supersedes prior designs in the same problem space, explicitly naming the superseded documents in the PRD prevents confusion about which document is authoritative. The PRD stated "Both existing orchestrator PRDs (2026-03-28-external-orchestrator.md, 2026-03-28-orchestrator.md) are superseded by this design" — naming files, not just describing the relationship.
### Rationale
Without explicit supersession, multiple PRDs for the same problem space coexist as peers, and downstream phases may reference the wrong one. Naming the specific files makes the deprecation grep-able.
### Source
.beastmode/artifacts/design/2026-03-28-typescript-pipeline-orchestrator.md
### Confidence
[LOW] — first-time observation; related to Obs 3 (challenge deferrals) and Obs 12 (prerequisite absorption) as another design decision lifecycle pattern

## Observation 14
### Context
During typescript-pipeline-orchestrator design, 2026-03-28
### Observation
When a design explicitly breaks a previously locked project constraint, documenting the override with rationale in the PRD prevents silent contradictions. The PRD stated "Prior decision #6 (no runtime dependencies) is explicitly overridden: the CLI is a separate package with its own dependency story." This names the specific decision number and provides the justification.
### Rationale
Locked decisions are treated as contracts. When a design intentionally breaks the contract, the override should be as explicit as the original lock — otherwise future sessions may flag the contradiction as a bug rather than a deliberate choice.
### Source
.beastmode/artifacts/design/2026-03-28-typescript-pipeline-orchestrator.md
### Confidence
[LOW] — first-time observation; extends the "locked decisions can drift" pattern into proactive override documentation

## Observation 15
### Context
During status-unfuckery-v2 design, 2026-03-29
### Observation
The v1 design (status-unfuckery) shipped as v0.35.0 but left critical bugs including type regressions and a lastUpdated field that was removed from the type but still read by the status command. A v2 overhaul was needed because v1 scoped too narrowly -- it fixed surface symptoms without auditing the full subsystem. The v2 design explicitly framed itself as a comprehensive overhaul rather than incremental bug fixes, and found 20 bugs that v1 missed.
### Rationale
When a shipped v1 leaves critical bugs, the question is whether to patch incrementally or overhaul. The indicator for overhaul is when the bug count is high and the bugs span multiple subsystem boundaries (scanner, command, types, watch). Incremental patches compound into spaghetti when the root cause is structural.
### Source
.beastmode/artifacts/design/2026-03-29-status-unfuckery-v2.md
### Confidence
[LOW] -- first observation; related to Obs 3 (challenge deferrals) and Obs 12 (prerequisite absorption) as a scope lifecycle pattern

## Observation 16
### Context
During manifest-file-management design, 2026-03-29
### Observation
The design absorbed the directory rename (state/ to artifacts/, pipeline/ to state/) and .gitignore updates into the same PRD as the module architecture refactor, rather than splitting the rename into a prerequisite PR. The rationale was "Big bang -- one atomic commit" covering both structural changes and code changes. The 49 context docs needing vocabulary updates were also scoped into the same migration.
### Rationale
Confirms the prerequisite-absorption pattern from Obs 12. When a prerequisite (directory rename, vocabulary update) is structurally coupled to the main design (module architecture that depends on the new directory layout), absorbing it prevents the prerequisite from becoming a coordination bottleneck. The coupling indicator is: "would the main design need to reference the prerequisite's output paths?" If yes, absorb.
### Source
.beastmode/artifacts/design/2026-03-29-manifest-file-management.md
### Confidence
[LOW] -- second observation of prerequisite-absorption (see Obs 12), but in a closely related problem space (same codebase subsystem)

## Observation 17
### Context
During plan-wave-sequencing design, 2026-03-31
### Observation
The design chose wave numbers (a flat ordered list) over explicit dependency graphs (a DAG) as the ordering primitive for feature sequencing. The rationale was explicit: "Wave number is the sole ordering primitive. This keeps the model simple -- if explicit dependency tracking is needed later, it can be added without breaking the wave model." The upgrade path was documented in Deferred Ideas and Out of Scope, making the simplification deliberate rather than accidental.
### Rationale
When multiple modeling approaches satisfy requirements, choosing the simplest primitive with an explicit upgrade path reduces implementation complexity and preserves future extensibility. The key indicator is: does the simpler model satisfy all current user stories? If yes, defer the complex model. The upgrade path must be documented (Out of Scope + Deferred Ideas) to prevent future designers from reinventing the analysis.
### Source
.beastmode/artifacts/design/2026-03-31-plan-wave-sequencing.md
### Confidence
[LOW] -- first-time observation; related to Obs 11 (over-include with prune) and Obs 3 (challenge deferrals) as another scope-simplification strategy, but distinct: this is about choosing the simplest modeling primitive, not about what to include or defer

## Observation 18
### Context
During plan-wave-sequencing design, 2026-03-31
### Observation
Backwards compatibility was applied as a cross-cutting constraint across multiple design decisions: manifest schema defaults wave to 1, single-feature plans get wave 1 automatically, existing manifests without wave fields behave identically to current behavior. Rather than a single compatibility decision, this was a systematic check applied to each decision point: "what happens to existing data that lacks this new field?"
### Rationale
When extending a schema or behavior model, applying a "what happens to existing instances?" check at each decision point prevents breakage from accumulating across decisions. The default-to-existing-behavior pattern (new field defaults to value that preserves current behavior) is the standard approach. The design explicitly called out backwards compatibility in user stories (Story 5), implementation decisions, and testing decisions, making it a first-class constraint rather than an afterthought.
### Source
.beastmode/artifacts/design/2026-03-31-plan-wave-sequencing.md
### Confidence
[LOW] -- first-time observation; distinct from locked-decision-drift (miscellaneous Obs 3) which is about implementation diverging from design, and from constraint-override (scope-management Obs 14) which is about intentionally breaking a constraint. This is about proactively preserving compatibility when adding new capabilities.
