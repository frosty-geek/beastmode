/**
 * Regression test for the dispatch race condition.
 *
 * When multiple implement sessions complete simultaneously, their
 * watchSession callbacks all call rescanEpic concurrently. Without
 * the reservation mechanism in DispatchTracker, each rescan would
 * see pending features with no active session and dispatch duplicates.
 *
 * This test verifies that the reserve/unreserve mechanism prevents
 * double-dispatch even when rescans interleave at await points.
