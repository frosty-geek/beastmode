Feature: Regression loop -- validate failure triggers reset and re-implement

  When validation fails, the XState reconciler sends a REGRESS event that
  resets all features to pending status and moves the manifest phase back
  to implement. This allows the team to re-implement and re-validate without
  abandoning the epic or manually recovering state.

  This feature exercises the regression path: design → plan (with multiple
  features across waves) → implement all features → validate with failure →
  REGRESS event resets state → re-implement → re-validate with success →
  release → done.

  The pipeline result remains successful (dispatch succeeded), but the manifest
  phase changes back to "implement" and all feature statuses reset to "pending".

  Scenario: Validate failure triggers regression, features reset, re-implement succeeds

    # -- Phase 1: Design with slug rename --
    Given the initial epic slug is "hex0a1b2c"
    And a manifest is seeded for slug "hex0a1b2c"

    When the dispatch will write a design artifact:
      | field    | value                           |
      | phase    | design                          |
      | slug     | hex0a1b2c                       |
      | epic     | auth-flow                       |
      | problem  | Complex OAuth integration       |
      | solution | Streamlined auth service        |
    And the pipeline runs the "design" phase
    Then the pipeline result should be successful
    And the manifest slug should be "auth-flow"
    And the manifest phase should be "plan"

    # -- Phase 2: Plan with multi-wave features --
    When the dispatch will write plan artifacts:
      | feature      | wave | description                |
      | oauth-server | 1    | OAuth2 provider setup      |
      | client-lib   | 1    | Client library integration |
      | token-cache  | 2    | Token caching layer        |
    And the pipeline runs the "plan" phase
    Then the pipeline result should be successful
    And the manifest phase should be "implement"
    And the manifest should have 3 features
    And all features should have status "pending"

    # -- Phase 3a: Implement wave 1 features --
    When the dispatch will write an implement artifact for feature "oauth-server"
    And the pipeline runs the "implement" phase for feature "oauth-server"
    Then the pipeline result should be successful
    And feature "oauth-server" should have status "completed"

    When the dispatch will write an implement artifact for feature "client-lib"
    And the pipeline runs the "implement" phase for feature "client-lib"
    Then the pipeline result should be successful
    And feature "client-lib" should have status "completed"

    # -- Phase 3b: Implement wave 2 features --
    When the dispatch will write an implement artifact for feature "token-cache"
    And the pipeline runs the "implement" phase for feature "token-cache"
    Then the pipeline result should be successful
    And feature "token-cache" should have status "completed"
    And the manifest phase should be "validate"

    # -- Phase 4a: Validate with FAILURE --
    When the dispatch will write a validate artifact with status "failed"
    And the pipeline runs the "validate" phase
    Then the pipeline result should be successful
    And the pipeline result should indicate regression
    And the manifest phase should be "implement"
    And all features should have status "pending"

    # -- Phase 3c: Re-implement after regression --
    When the dispatch will write an implement artifact for feature "oauth-server"
    And the pipeline runs the "implement" phase for feature "oauth-server"
    Then the pipeline result should be successful
    And feature "oauth-server" should have status "completed"

    When the dispatch will write an implement artifact for feature "client-lib"
    And the pipeline runs the "implement" phase for feature "client-lib"
    Then the pipeline result should be successful
    And feature "client-lib" should have status "completed"

    When the dispatch will write an implement artifact for feature "token-cache"
    And the pipeline runs the "implement" phase for feature "token-cache"
    Then the pipeline result should be successful
    And feature "token-cache" should have status "completed"
    And the manifest phase should be "validate"

    # -- Phase 4b: Re-validate with SUCCESS --
    When the dispatch will write a validate artifact with status "passed"
    And the pipeline runs the "validate" phase
    Then the pipeline result should be successful
    And the manifest phase should be "release"

    # -- Phase 5: Release --
    When the dispatch will write a release artifact with bump "minor"
    And the pipeline runs the "release" phase
    Then the pipeline result should be successful
    And the manifest phase should be "done"
    And the worktree should be cleaned up
