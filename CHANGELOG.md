- **Context doc updates** — `github-state-model.md` gains NEVER rule for Feature board-add; `DESIGN.md` summary updated to reflect epics-only model
- **Orchestrator revert** — Reverted TypeScript CLI orchestrator (v0.25.0) in favor of Justfile + CronCreate architecture; updated context docs to reflect current model

### v0.26.0 — The Orchestrator Blueprint (Mar 2026)

- **Orchestrator PRD** — CronCreate-based poll loop, worktree-isolated agents, per-epic teams, manifest convergence
- **Orchestration L2 context** — domain rules for local-first state, worktree isolation, config.yaml gates

### v0.25.0 — The TypeScript Pipeline (Mar 2026)

- **TypeScript CLI orchestrator** — `beastmode` CLI built with Bun and Claude Agent SDK for phase execution and pipeline orchestration (reverted in v0.27.0)

### v0.24.0 — The Epics-Only Board (Mar 2026)

- **Epics-only board model** — Removed `gh project item-add` calls for Feature issues from plan checkpoint, implement prime, and implement checkpoint; only Epics are added to the Projects V2 board

- **Context doc updates** — `github-state-model.md` gains NEVER rule for Feature board-add; `DESIGN.md` summary updated to reflect epics-only model

### v0.23.0 — The Project Board (Mar 2026)

- **Pipeline status field** — Setup-github creates a 7-option Pipeline field (Backlog, Design, Plan, Implement, Validate, Release, Done) with color-coded statuses via GraphQL
- **Project metadata cache** — Setup-github writes `.beastmode/state/github-project.cache.json` with project ID, field ID, and option ID map for downstream checkpoint use
- **Issue backfill** — Setup-github adds all existing `type/epic` and `type/feature` issues to the project with Status derived from their current labels
- **Shared project sync** — New "Add to Project + Set Status" operation in `_shared/github.md` handles idempotent project item addition and status updates
- **Checkpoint project sync** — All 5 phase checkpoints sync Epic and Feature issues to the project board at every transition
- **Cache field name fix** — Fixed `pipelineField` vs `statusField` naming inconsistency between cache writer and reader

### v0.22.0 — The External Orchestrator (Mar 2026)

- **Justfile orchestrator** — Thin CLI shell with recipes for each phase (`just design`, `just plan`, `just implement`, `just validate`, `just release`). Invokes `claude --worktree` interactively.
- **WorktreeCreate hook** — Smart branch detection: if `feature/<slug>` exists, branch from it; otherwise default `origin/HEAD` behavior
- **Skill purification** — Removed all worktree creation/entry/assertion logic and phase transition gates from every skill. Skills are now pure content processors.
- **Checkpoint handoff** — All 5 phase checkpoints print `just <next-phase> <slug>` instead of auto-chaining via `Skill()` calls
- **Commit-per-phase** — Each phase commits to the feature branch at checkpoint. Release squash-merges to main.
- **Config cleanup** — Removed `transitions` section from `.beastmode/config.yaml`

### v0.21.0 — The GitHub Phase Integration (Mar 2026)

- **Manifest-based state tracking** — JSON manifest created at design checkpoint, enriched at plan (features array + architectural decisions), updated at implement (feature status transitions). Local authority for feature lifecycle.
- **GitHub sync at checkpoints** — Optional "Sync GitHub" step in all 5 phase checkpoints creates/advances/closes Epic and Feature issues at checkpoint boundaries. Gated on `github.enabled` config toggle.
- **Setup subcommand update** — `/beastmode setup-github` now creates 12 labels (dropped status/review), Projects V2 board, and writes `github.enabled: true` to config
- **Warn-and-continue error handling** — All GitHub API calls wrapped in try/catch pattern: print warning, skip sync, continue with local state. Workflow never blocked by GitHub.
- **Status rewrite** — `/beastmode status` reads manifests from worktrees, shows per-feature status (pending/in-progress/blocked/completed) with GitHub issue links when enabled
- **Config extension** — New `github.enabled` (default: false) and `github.project-name` keys in `.beastmode/config.yaml`
- **Shared GitHub utility update** — Added error handling convention section and set-status-label operation to `_shared/github.md`

### v0.20.0 — The Feature Decomposition (Mar 2026)

- **PRD-to-features** — /plan now decomposes PRDs into independent architectural feature plans (vertical slices) instead of monolithic implementation plans
- **Feature manifest** — New manifest JSON tracks feature status, architectural decisions, and PRD link across all features in a design
- **Task decomposition moves to /implement** — Detailed wave/task breakdown now happens at implement time, not plan time, giving /implement full autonomy over execution strategy
- **Baseline-aware spec checks** — Implement tracks a baseline snapshot at prime to prevent false positives when features share a worktree
- **Manifest-gated validation** — /validate checks all features are completed via manifest before proceeding
- **Two-tier plan approval** — New `feature-set-approval` (human) and `feature-approval` (auto) gates replace the old single `plan-approval`
- **Feature format template** — New reference template for architectural feature plans: user stories, what to build, acceptance criteria (no file paths, no code)

### v0.19.0 — The PRD Pivot (Mar 2026)

- **Decision tree interviews** — /design now walks every branch of the design tree one question at a time with Claude's recommendation, replacing the old gray-area-first batch loop
- **Two-pass flow** — Full decision tree walk first, then gray area sweep as a second pass to catch big-picture blind spots the tree missed
- **Inline exploration** — Codebase reads and research happen during the interview instead of requiring separate triggers in prime
- **Module sketch step** — New step between interview and PRD writing identifies deep modules (encapsulate complexity behind simple testable interfaces)
- **Prior decisions gate** — New `design.prior-decisions` gate (default: auto) applies context/meta decisions silently so settled questions don't get re-asked
- **PRD output format** — Design artifacts now follow standardized PRD template: Problem Statement, Solution, User Stories, Implementation Decisions, Testing Decisions, Out of Scope, Further Notes, Deferred Ideas
- **New gate set** — Replaced 4 old design gates (intent-discussion, approach-selection, section-review, design-approval) with 4 new ones (decision-tree, gray-areas, prior-decisions, prd-approval)

### v0.18.0 — The GitHub State Model (Mar 2026)

- **GitHub state model** — Two-level issue hierarchy (Epic > Feature) with label-based state machines, externalizing workflow lifecycle to GitHub Issues and Projects V2
- **Shared GitHub utility** — Reusable API operations for auth, labels, issues, sub-issues, and Projects V2
- **Setup subcommand** — `/beastmode setup-github` bootstraps labels, project board, columns, repo linking (idempotent)
- **Config extension** — backlog-to-design and release-to-done transitions, github.project-name setting

### v0.17.0 — The Full Spectrum Init (Mar 2026)

- **17-domain skeleton** — Skeleton assets expanded from 7 to 17 L2 files covering design (4), plan (4), implement (3), validate (2), release (4), each with matching L3 directories and `.gitkeep`
- **Inventory agent expansion** — Detects all 17 domains with specific detection signals for 10 new domains (domain-model, error-handling, workflow, build, quality-gates, validation-patterns, versioning, changelog, deployment, distribution)
- **Writer agent retro-format** — L2 output switched from prose paragraphs to ALWAYS/NEVER bullets with em-dash rationale; L3 records use Context/Decision/Rationale format matching retro agents
- **Init retro phase** — New phase spawns retro-context agents (one per phase) after writers complete, processing state/ artifacts and populating meta/ files
- **Synthesize agent expansion** — Generates all 10 L1 files (5 context + 5 meta) instead of only context; meta L1 format mirrors context L1
- **5-phase init flow** — Init restructured from 3 phases (inventory → populate → synthesize) to 5 (skeleton → inventory → write → retro → synthesize)

### v0.16.0 — The Discovery Engine (Mar 2026)

- **Init system redesigned** — Replaced 5 narrow init agents + greenfield wizard with 3-phase layered discovery: Inventory (orchestrator reads all project knowledge) → Populate (parallel writers create L2 summaries + L3 records) → Synthesize (generates L1 summaries, rewrites CLAUDE.md)
- **Knowledge map architecture** — Inventory agent reads 7 source types (CLAUDE.md, README, docs, plans, source structure, git history, config files) and produces structured knowledge map with L2 topic assignments
- **L3 record creation** — Writer agents create L3 decision records with source attribution from all discoverable sources
- **Dynamic topic discovery** — Proposes new L2 topics when 3+ items cluster beyond the 6 base topics
- **Greenfield mode removed** — Empty projects get skeleton only and evolve through /design sessions

### v0.15.0 — The Hook Fix (Mar 2026)

- **Hook field removed from plugin.json** — The `hooks` reference to `./hooks/hooks.json` caused plugin loading issues; removed to restore correct behavior

### v0.14.38 — The Spring Cleaning (Mar 2026)

- **First-class init agents** — 5 init-* agents made self-contained with `@common-instructions.md` import; dispatched via registered `beastmode:init-*` types instead of manual prompt assembly
- **common-instructions.md relocated** — Moved from `skills/beastmode/references/discovery-agents/` to `agents/`
- **Brownfield dispatch simplified** — `init.md` prompt assembly + concatenation replaced with direct registered agent dispatch
- **Dead reference docs removed** — Deleted `gate-check.md` and `transition-check.md` (both "Reference Only — NOT @imported")

### v0.14.37 — The Gate Tightener (Mar 2026)

- **Structural HARD-GATE enforcement** — Worktree entry/creation sections wrapped in `<HARD-GATE>` tags with numbered procedure bullets, replacing verbose prose enforcement
- **Design worktree placement** — Worktree creation moved from design/1-execute to design/3-checkpoint (step 0), matching the phase's actual needs
- **Prime-first worktree entry** — plan/implement/validate/release enter worktree as step 1 of 0-prime, before announce or context load
- **Bare assert pattern** — validate/release 1-execute slimmed to one-line worktree-manager assert calls
- **Redundant prose removal** — Eliminated "MANDATORY", "no exceptions", "lightweight" enforcement language; gate tags handle enforcement

### v0.14.36 — The Great Deletion (Mar 2026)

- **Context window handling removed** — Deleted `context-report.md`, `visual-language.md`, and all phase indicator / context report references from prime and checkpoint phases
- **Context bridge removed** — Deleted `context-bridge-hook.sh`, `context-bridge-statusline.sh`, and PostToolUse hook from `hooks.json`
- **Auto-transitions simplified** — All auto transition gates now chain unconditionally via `Skill()` calls; no more threshold estimation or low-context fallback
- **Knowledge hierarchy updated** — L1/L2 context docs cleaned of stale threshold, context report, and context bridge references
- **Config simplified** — Removed `context_threshold` from `config.yaml` and `BEASTMODE.md` phase indicator reference

### v0.14.35 — The Context Bridge (Mar 2026)

- **Statusline context persistence** — New `context-bridge-statusline.sh` writes real context window metrics (used%, remaining%, window size) to `/tmp/beastmode-{session_id}.json` per session
- **PostToolUse context injection** — New `context-bridge-hook.sh` reads persisted metrics and injects raw context data as `additionalContext`, replacing estimation with ground truth
- **Plugin-managed hooks** — New `hooks/hooks.json` declares SessionStart and PostToolUse hooks with `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}` portable paths; migrated from project settings to plugin manifest
- **Settings cleanup** — Removed hook declarations from `.claude/settings.local.json` (now plugin-managed via `plugin.json` hooks field)

### v0.14.34 — The Task-Runner Enforcer (Mar 2026)

- **Tightened HARD-GATE contract** — All 5 skill HARD-GATE blocks now require TodoWrite as the first tool call, making task-runner execution verifiable
- **Anti-freestyle enforcement** — "Do not output anything else first" prevents agents from skipping the framework and running sessions conversationally
- **Anti-rationalization line** — "Do not skip this for simple tasks" preempts the "this is too lightweight" excuse
- **Init skeleton restructured** — Init assets now match evolved reality: BEASTMODE.md, config.yaml, research/, full L3 directory tree with .gitkeep
- **PRODUCT.md → context/design/product.md** — Root-level product file moved to proper hierarchy position
- **State simplified** — No more L1 state files; just 5 phase subdirs with .gitkeep
- **Meta L2 templates** — All 5 phases get process.md + workarounds.md + L3 record directories

### v0.14.33 — The Hierarchy Gates (Mar 2026)

- **Hierarchy-aligned retro gates** — Four gates match the knowledge hierarchy: `retro.records` (L3), `retro.context` (L2), `retro.phase` (L1), `retro.beastmode` (L0)
- **Bottom-up gate ordering** — Gates fire L3 → L0, approving lower levels before higher ones
- **Parallel walker spawning** — Context and meta walkers launch simultaneously, outputs merged by hierarchy level before gating
- **Unified L0 gating** — `release.beastmode-md-approval` absorbed into `retro.beastmode`, available to any phase
- **Explicit L1 gating** — L1 summary recomputation and promotions gated through `retro.phase` instead of being a silent side-effect

### v0.14.32 — The Worktree Enforcer (Mar 2026)

- **HARD-GATE worktree enforcement** — `<HARD-GATE>` blocks before worktree steps in all 5 phase files prevent Claude from rationalizing "lightweight" exceptions
- **L0 worktree rule** — BEASTMODE.md Workflow section includes `NEVER skip worktree creation` as a prime directive
- **Assert Worktree anti-rationalization** — worktree-manager.md documents the known failure mode where Claude skips worktree creation for "documentation-only" tasks

- Removed standalone `/status` skill and `install` subcommand

### v0.14.28 — The Conversational Design (Mar 2026)

- **Conversational intent flow** — Design execute phase collapsed from 8 steps to 5, replacing batch-question mechanics with one-question-at-a-time conversational flow
- **On-demand codebase reading** — Scout step merged into intent understanding; code is read as questions arise rather than upfront
- **Gray area batches of 3** — Users multi-select from 3 most unclear areas with "Claude's Discretion" bucket, loop until satisfied
- **Approach-selection gate** — New `design.approach-selection` gate separates approach choice from gray area discussion
- **Scope guardrail** — Out-of-scope suggestions captured as deferred ideas, not lost

- **Records template** — L3 records use `>>`/`+` prefixes with one-sentence summaries, domain and confidence tags
- **Promotions template** — Shows actual ALWAYS/NEVER rules being promoted with `^` prefix and basis

### v0.14.25 — The Worktree Alignment Lock (Mar 2026)

- **Centralized feature naming** — Single `Derive Feature Name` section in worktree-manager.md ensures worktree directory names and artifact filenames always match 1:1
- **Assert Worktree guard** — pwd-based check in worktree-manager.md prevents `.beastmode/` writes outside a worktree; called by all 5 checkpoint phases, retro, and release pre-merge
- **Retro agent path injection** — Context Walker and Meta Walker receive absolute `worktree_root` path, eliminating relative-path drift
- **Release two-phase split** — Explicit TRANSITION BOUNDARY separates pre-merge (worktree) from post-merge (main) operations

### v0.6.1 — No More Rebase (Mar 2026)

- **Merge-only release** — Replaced `git rebase origin/main` with merge-only strategy; conflicts resolve once instead of per-commit replay
- **Fewer version files** — Dropped hardcoded version from README.md badge and PRODUCT.md `Current Version` section; version now lives in 3 files (plugin.json, marketplace.json, session-start.sh)

### v0.6.0 — The Paper Trail (Mar 2026)

- **README rewrite** — Restructured following high-star GitHub patterns: centered hero, badges, install-first layout, removed credibility killers

### v0.5.0 — Parallel Waves (Mar 2026)

- **Parallel wave dispatch** — /implement spawns agents concurrently within waves when file isolation analysis confirms no overlaps
- **File isolation analysis** — /plan detects file overlap per wave, auto-resequences conflicts, marks safe waves with `Parallel-safe: true`
- **Sequential fallback** — Graceful degradation to sequential dispatch when parallel safety can't be verified

### v0.4.1 — The Big Redesign (Mar 2026)
