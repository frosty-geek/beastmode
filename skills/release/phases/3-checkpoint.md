# 3. Checkpoint

## 0. Conditional Compaction

Check whether context tree compaction is due before retro runs.

### 0.1 Check Compaction Cadence

```bash
last_compaction_file=".beastmode/state/.last-compaction"

if [ -f "$last_compaction_file" ]; then
    last_ts=$(cat "$last_compaction_file")
    release_count=$(git log --oneline --since="$last_ts" --grep="^Release v" | wc -l | tr -d ' ')
else
    release_count=999  # Force compaction on first run
fi

echo "Releases since last compaction: $release_count"
```

If `release_count` < 5, print "Compaction not due (N/5 releases). Skipping." and proceed to Step 1.

### 0.2 Spawn Compaction Agent

Read the agent prompt from `agents/compaction.md`.

Build the agent prompt with:

```
## Compaction Context
- **Mode**: release
- **Slug**: <feature>
- **Working directory**: <current working directory>
```

Spawn: `Agent(subagent_type="general-purpose", prompt=<built prompt>)`

Wait for completion.

### 0.3 Update Timestamp

After successful compaction:

```bash
date -u +%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ > .beastmode/state/.last-compaction
```

### 0.4 Copy Report to Release Artifacts

The compaction agent writes to `artifacts/compact/YYYY-MM-DD-compaction.md`. Copy it to release artifacts:

```bash
cp .beastmode/artifacts/compact/YYYY-MM-DD-compaction.md \
   .beastmode/artifacts/release/YYYY-MM-DD-<slug>-compaction.md
```

Print the compaction summary from the agent's output, then proceed to Step 1.

## 1. Phase Retro

@../_shared/retro.md

> **TRANSITION BOUNDARY — Steps below operate from main repo, NOT the feature branch working directory.**

## 2. Commit to Feature Branch

Before merging to main, commit all release artifacts to the feature branch.

If a `<commit-refs>` block is present in the prompt context, extract each line from it and append as additional `-m` arguments to the commit command:

```bash
git add -A
git commit -m "release(<feature>): checkpoint" \
  -m "Refs #<epic>" \
  -m "Refs #<feature>"
```

If no `<commit-refs>` block is present, commit without ref lines:

```bash
git add -A
git commit -m "release(<feature>): checkpoint"
```

## 3. Squash Merge to Main

```bash
feature_dir=$(pwd)
feature_branch=$(git branch --show-current)
main_repo=$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel)/..

cd "$main_repo"
git checkout main
git pull
git tag "archive/$feature_branch"
git merge --squash "$feature_branch"
```

**Important:** The squash merge stages changes but does NOT commit. Proceed to step 4.

### 3.1. Resolve Conflicts

If the squash merge produces conflicts:

- **Code files** (`.ts`, `.tsx`, `.js`, etc.): resolve with `--theirs` (feature branch has the new implementation)
- **CHANGELOG.md**: resolve with `--ours` (main has the complete history; new entry is added in step 5)
- **Version files** (plugin.json, marketplace.json, session-start.sh): resolve with `--ours` (main has the correct current version; bump happens in step 6)
- **Other .beastmode/ files**: resolve with `--theirs` (feature branch has the latest state)

## 4. Compute Version

Read the **current version from main** (not from the worktree):

```bash
current_version=$(grep -o '"version": "[^"]*"' .claude-plugin/plugin.json | head -1 | cut -d'"' -f4)
echo "Current version on main: $current_version"
```

Read the bump type from the release notes YAML frontmatter (written during execute):

```yaml
---
phase: release
slug: <feature>
bump: minor
---
```

Apply:
- **major**: increment major, reset minor and patch to 0
- **minor**: increment minor, reset patch to 0
- **patch**: increment patch

## 5. Update CHANGELOG.md

Prepend the new release section to CHANGELOG.md **on main** using the computed version. Use the categorized changes from the release notes generated in execute step 4.

## 6. Bump Version Files

Update version in all files **on main**:
- `.claude-plugin/plugin.json` → `"version": "X.Y.Z"`
- `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json` → version in plugins array
- `hooks/session-start.sh` → banner line `BEASTMODE vX.Y.Z`

## 7. Update Release Artifacts

Update the release notes **on main** to include the actual computed version:
- `.beastmode/artifacts/release/YYYY-MM-DD-<feature>.md` → replace `**Bump:** type` with `**Version:** vX.Y.Z`

## 8. Commit Release

Create the single commit with GitHub release style message.

If a `<commit-refs>` block is present in the prompt context, extract only the epic ref line (`Refs #<epic>`) and append it as an additional `-m` argument. Feature refs are omitted from the main branch commit — they live in the feature branch history.

```bash
git add -A
git commit -m "Release vX.Y.Z — <Title from CHANGELOG>

## Features
- <feature 1>
- <feature 2>

## Fixes
- <fix 1>

## Artifacts
- Design: .beastmode/artifacts/design/YYYY-MM-DD-<feature>.md
- Plan: .beastmode/artifacts/plan/YYYY-MM-DD-<feature>.md
- Release: .beastmode/artifacts/release/YYYY-MM-DD-<feature>.md
" \
  -m "Refs #<epic>"
```

If no `<commit-refs>` block is present, commit without the ref line.

Use the release notes generated in execute step 4 and categorized commits from execute step 3 as the commit body. Omit empty sections (no Fixes if none exist).

## 9. Git Tagging

```bash
git tag -a vX.Y.Z -m "Release X.Y.Z"
```

Suggest: `git push origin main && git push origin vX.Y.Z`

## 10. Plugin Marketplace Update

Suggest running:
```bash
claude plugin marketplace update
claude plugin update beastmode@beastmode-marketplace --scope user 
```

## 11. Complete

"Release complete."
