## 1. Discover and Enter Feature Worktree

1. **Discover Feature** — resolve feature name from arguments or filesystem scan via [worktree-manager.md](../_shared/worktree-manager.md). Do NOT search for similarly named worktrees or artifacts.
2. **Enter Worktree** — cd into the worktree and verify with pwd.

The resolved `feature` name is used for all artifact paths in this phase.
</HARD-GATE>

## 2. Announce Skill

Greet in persona voice. One sentence. Set expectations for what this phase does and what the user's role is.

@../_shared/persona.md

## 3. Load Project Context

Read (if they exist):
- `.beastmode/context/VALIDATE.md`
- `.beastmode/meta/VALIDATE.md`

Follow L2 convention paths (`context/validate/{domain}.md`) when relevant to the current topic.
Prior decisions, conventions, and learnings inform this phase — don't re-decide what's already been decided.

## 4. Check Feature Completion

Resolve the manifest using [worktree-manager.md](../_shared/worktree-manager.md) → "Resolve Manifest" with the design name.

Read the manifest JSON. Check all features have status `completed`.

Print status:

```
Feature Completion Check
────────────────────────
✓ feature-1 — completed
✓ feature-2 — completed
✗ feature-3 — pending

Result: BLOCKED — 1 feature still pending
```

If any features are NOT completed:
- Print which features are pending
- STOP — do not proceed to test execution
- Suggest: "Run `/beastmode:implement <design>-<pending-feature>` to complete remaining features."

If all completed: proceed to next step.

## 5. Identify Test Strategy

From context, determine:
- Test command (e.g., `npm test`, `pytest`)
- Lint command (if configured)
- Type check command (if configured)
- Custom gates from meta
