# 3. Checkpoint

## 1. Write Design Doc

Save to `.beastmode/state/design/YYYY-MM-DD-<topic>.md`

Include:
- Goal statement
- Approach summary
- Key Decisions
  - Locked Decisions (explicitly approved by user)
  - Claude's Discretion (delegated to implementation)
- Component breakdown
- Files affected
- Acceptance Criteria
- Testing strategy
- Deferred Ideas (or "none")

## 2. Extract Acceptance Criteria

Before writing the doc, review the discussion for testable conditions.

Format as checkable items:
- [ ] [Specific, verifiable condition]

If no clear criteria emerged during discussion, include:
"No explicit acceptance criteria emerged — /plan should define these from the design decisions."

## 3. Phase Retro

## 4. Context Report

## 5. Phase Transition

<!-- HITL-GATE: transitions.design-to-plan | TRANSITION -->
@../_shared/transition-check.md

Do NOT invoke any implementation skill directly — only via transition-check auto mode.
